# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- **Live Kimi Code sessions show their context ring.** The row reads the context Kimi measured after the last turn and the window it requested from the tail of the session wire, the same numbers Kimi prints in its own footer.
- **CodeBurn tells you when OpenAI banks a limit reset on your Codex account.** These grants — the "banked" or "goodwill" resets that restore a rate-limit window early — are sometimes announced and sometimes not, and until now the only way to notice one was to go looking. The reset-credit inventory CodeBurn already reads on every Codex quota refresh is now compared against the previous reading: a credit seen for the first time posts one notification naming what was granted, when it landed and how many you have available to use. The first reading after connecting is a baseline, not news; a credit that disappears because you spent it says nothing; a failed fetch or a malformed payload is treated as no opinion rather than as an empty account, so reconnecting does not re-announce what you were already told; and the fired event is persisted next to the existing quota snapshots, so a relaunch does not repeat it. Settings → Notifications gains a switch for it, on by default. The count and the most recent grant also appear in the Codex Plan tab, in the agent-tab quota hover card, and as a `Limit resets · …` line in `codeburn quota` (text and `--format json`), worded identically on both sides. No new endpoint, no new polling loop and no new data source: this reads fields off a response already fetched on the existing cadence, per the rule #702/#724 established. CodeBurn never spends a credit — this is a notice only. (#725)
- **Kimi Code sessions now show up in the live-sessions block.** A Kimi session whose `agents/*/wire.jsonl` was written inside the liveness window is reported as `kimicode`, with its project, the model of its last request and the activity of its sub-agents folded in.

### Added (macOS)
- **Clicking a live session in the Capacity Dock card raises the terminal it is running in.** The row's process is found from Claude Code's own `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` or, for Kimi Code, from the one `kimi` working in the session's directory, and the process tree is walked up to the application that owns it: Terminal.app and iTerm2 get the exact tab selected by tty, every other terminal is brought to the front. A row whose process cannot be found stays inert, with no pointer change and no tooltip.
- **Launching the menubar app replaces the copy already running instead of stacking a second Capacity Dock on the screen edge.** At launch it terminates only *strictly older* instances of its own bundle identifier, so two simultaneous launches cannot quit each other and leave none, and an older copy that ignores the polite quit is forced out a few seconds later.
- **The menubar tells you when a quota window crosses 80% and again when it hits its limit.** Every connected provider's windows — the same list the menu-bar flame and the popover warning row are built from — are checked on the quota refresh that already runs, with no new polling: crossing 80% posts `Claude · Weekly at 80%`, reaching the limit posts `Claude · Weekly limit reached`. Each fires once per window per cycle, a window that hits its limit without ever having been seen at 80% posts only the limit notice, and the cycle's reset instant is part of the identity, so the next cycle re-arms both while an absent or failed fetch keeps what was already announced. The fired set is persisted, so a relaunch does not repeat a crossing. Notification authorization is requested on the first real crossing and never at launch. Settings → Notifications gains a switch, on by default.
- **The macOS menubar app speaks Simplified Chinese, and follows your system language to decide.** Every user-facing string in the popover, the Capacity Dock, the status-item menu, the update alerts and all of Settings now resolves through a `Localizable.strings` catalog shipped for `en` and `zh-Hans` with no third-party library: 628 keys, whose key *is* the English copy, so an untranslated string degrades to correct English rather than a visible identifier. AppKit picks the table from the user's preferred languages; Settings > General > Language overrides it for CodeBurn alone by writing `AppleLanguages` into the app's own preferences domain, which is the same key `CFBundleLocalizations` makes System Settings > Language & Region > Applications write, so the two surfaces are one setting rather than two. Enum raw values that double as persistence or cache keys (`Period`, `MenubarScope`, `InsightMode`, `AccentPreset`, `ProviderFilter`) keep their raw value and gained a separate display label, so nothing a user has saved changes meaning. Three display-only date formatters that were pinned to `en_US_POSIX` with fixed patterns now follow the locale, and the calendar popover's weekday row comes from the locale's own short symbols clipped to two units, so a Chinese UI reads `2026年9月` and `周一 周二` while English keeps `Mo Tu We`. That locale move is the one place English output changes: `EEE MMM d` reads `Sat, Sep 12` in en_US and `Sat 12 Sep` in en_GB, and `MMM d` reads `12 Sep` in en_GB. Provider, model and plan names, units, currency codes, shell commands and anything the `codeburn` CLI itself produces stay verbatim in every locale. Adding a language is now one more `.lproj`; a test fails the build if the two tables disagree on keys, leave a value blank, or disagree on format specifiers, and a second test reads `mac/Sources` itself and fails when a user-facing literal never reaches the catalog at all — the drift a catalog-versus-catalog diff cannot see, because both tables stay in perfect agreement while a bare `Text("…")` ships English to a zh-Hans user. This covers the menubar half of #1219 only, not the CLI output or the web dashboard. (#1219)
- **The menubar tells you when a vendor resets your quota early, and what that provider's early resets have looked like.** Vendors sometimes reset a usage window ahead of schedule as a goodwill gesture; CodeBurn showed the new percentage but never said it had happened, so the free capacity went unused. Two signals now catch it on the refresh lifecycle that already runs, with no new polling: a reset time that jumps to a new cycle while the stored one still had time to run, and usage emptying (a fall of at least 40 points landing at or under 10%) while the advertised reset time stands still. A system notification through the existing notifier names the provider, the window and the lead, worded for the signal that saw it ("Claude's weekly limit reset 18h early. You're back to 100%." when the cycle rolled over, "Claude cleared your weekly usage 18h before its reset. You're back to 100%." when the counter emptied but the reset time held), the Capacity Dock carries a band saying the same for twelve hours, and the quota hover card gains this Mac's own pattern from the 30 days of snapshots already on disk ("Last 3 weekly resets came ~18h early"), derived from the stored reset times with no network and no external feed. One goodwill reset is one notification per provider however many windows it empties, and a reset already announced is never announced again — after a relaunch, or when the vendor briefly serves the old cycle back. It stays silent on a normal scheduled reset, a plan change, clock or timestamp skew, a window appearing or disappearing between fetches, a window's first observation, a reconnect after a terminal failure or a fresh bootstrap, and a window whose length the adapter does not validate; a missing or malformed stored reading is no opinion rather than an event. Settings → General → Notifications turns the notification off, default on, and with it off the dock band still appears. Claude is the provider wired up today, because it is the one whose quota readings are persisted. (#725)
- **The Capacity Dock shows today's cache-read tokens and tells you whether each quota window will last to its reset.** The Today section gains a provider-scoped cache-read figure beside input, output and calls; a known zero prints as `0` while missing or incomplete historical accounting stays unknown rather than becoming a fabricated zero, and because cache reads were already priced into the burned figure this adds visibility without changing any total. Each quota window then gets one line under it: `Lasts until reset`, `Runs out in 2d 8h`, or — on windows of six hours or less, where one burst would make a linear ETA cry wolf — the pace stage the Plan tab uses (`On pace`, `40% in deficit`, `30% in reserve`). The same line appears under each bar in the agent-tab quota hover card. The projection runs against the window length the provider adapter reports, never a length guessed from the display label, so a monthly cycle whose label happens to read `Weekly` is still paced against its month; it stays silent early in a window, on an exhausted window, without a reset time or a validated duration, and on stale, disconnected or older-than-ten-minute data. Four quota windows move to a two-column grid so scope labels, reset times and captions stay readable, and the dock reserves the caption's height whether or not a column has one so the bubble cannot resize under the pointer. Status snapshot revision 7 invalidates older cached payloads without purging daily history, and no extra polling is introduced. (#1267)
- **The macOS menubar item can show a second line.** Settings → General → Display gains a "Second row" switch, off by default, and a picker for what that line shows: quota remaining with its reset countdown for whichever connected provider is nearest its limit, today's all-provider cost, today's total tokens, or the number of running sessions. Both lines render as one attributed title at 9pt with their line height clamped to 10pt, so the pair fits the standard 22pt menu bar, and the second line hides itself whenever its metric has no data yet, leaving the existing single-row figure exactly as it was. This is a deliberately small first slice of the multi-row layout request: no layout editor, no presets, no live preview, no per-item provider or period scoping. The setting persists as `CodeBurnMenubarSecondRowEnabled` and `CodeBurnMenubarSecondRowMetric` in the app's own defaults domain alongside the existing menubar period, scope and metric keys. (#1252)
- **The Capacity Dock gauge can report the short usage window instead of the weekly one, without expanding the dock.** The resting rail shows one number per provider, and that number was always the weekly (else monthly) billing window. Clicking the provider already resting in the rail now switches its gauge to the provider's short rolling window — Claude's 5-hour limit, Codex's 5-hour or daily window, any `Hourly`, `Daily` or session row an adapter reports — and clicking again switches back. The choice is stored per provider under `CodeBurnCapacityDockGlanceWindows`, so Claude can sit on its 5-hour window while Codex stays weekly, and it survives relaunch. A per-model row such as `Weekly · Opus` is never read as a short window, a provider that reports only one window keeps the plain click-to-pin behaviour, and a stored horizon the provider stops reporting falls back to the window it does report rather than blanking the gauge to `--`. The rail's geometry is untouched, VoiceOver and keyboard users get the switch as a named action on the provider cell with the window named in the cell's value, and Escape or a click outside still unpins the dock. (#1243)

### Changed
- **Quota colours use one set of bands everywhere: green under 60%, yellow to 70%, orange to 95%, red from 95%.** The flame, the popover rows and the Capacity Dock rings each had their own thresholds; the dock now reads the same severity the flame does.
- **The Capacity Dock card and the popover quota rows no longer print a pace verdict under each window.** The "On pace" / "Lasts until reset" caption from #1314 added a third line to every window cell and made the card read as clutter; the cells are back to percent, label and countdown, up to three windows share one row again with a fourth wrapping to a second, and the pace math still feeds the tooltip and the agent-tab card.

### Fixed
- **The menubar refreshes usage within five minutes while a session is running, instead of up to thirty.** The background change guard only stats directories, so a session appending to its transcript looked unchanged and the app skipped every refresh for half an hour; the skip now lasts at most five minutes, and the Kimi Code session store joined the watched roots.
- **The Capacity Dock card lists running sessions for providers whose CLI id differs from the dock id.** The card matched live rows against the dock's own identifier ("kimi"), while the CLI reports "kimicode", so a running Kimi Code session read "none running"; the card now matches the provider's payload ids, which also lets the Cursor card count cursor-agent sessions.
- **Shared and MCP-redacted payloads no longer carry git branch names or the working directory of a session.** Two identities were riding along in `current`: the `topSessions` rows added in #1316 carry `projectKey`, a dash-encoded absolute path such as `-Users-<user>-Projects-<repo>`, which `redactProjectNames` left verbatim even when an MCP client asked not to see project names, and the per-branch rows added in #788 carry the raw branch, which both `sanitizeForSharing` and the MCP pass let through, so a branch such as `exp/extraction-arms` reached a shared payload as typed. The MCP pass now hashes `projectKey` with the same salted pseudonym it already applies to `topProjects[].id`, hashes the drill-through `sessionId` on both `topSessions` and `topProjects[].sessionDetails` (a Codex id embeds the rollout timestamp the pass blanks out of `date`), and gives each distinct branch a stable `branch-xxxxxx` pseudonym, keeping the cost, calls and session counts untouched; a `null` branch stays null, because unbranched spend is not a name. Sharing drops the per-branch block outright, the way it already drops the project and session rows, since a pseudonymized branch tells a peer device nothing anyway. Nothing changes for the local menubar, the desktop app or the web dashboard, which read the unsanitized payload, and nothing changes for an MCP caller that passes `include_project_names: true` — it still gets every name as recorded. (#1325, #1321)
- **A pull request row now opens the sessions that produced it.** Every other aggregate in the app drills through — a day bar, a model name, a task category, a project — but the Pull requests section only ever expanded and collapsed: the PR selection builder and the drill-through callback were threaded through the section four component levels deep and nothing ever called either, so the one report that names actual shipped work had no way into the sessions behind it. An expanded PR row now carries a `View sessions for this pull request →` control above its work breakdown, the same affordance a project row in Spend already offers; it selects the PR by its URL — the aggregation key the by-PR report is built on — and lands in Sessions with the chip applied and each session's per-turn contribution reconciled against its full cost. The control is its own click target rather than the row, so clicking it or pressing Enter on it never costs the expansion, and a legacy row with no per-turn detail offers it too. Two smaller items from the same review: the sessions list's return-to-the-first-page reset wrote internal state the app does not read while it owns the pagination depth, so revealing another 120 rows and then changing the sort or removing a chip left you deep inside a list that had just been reordered — the reset now rides the same commit as the change that caused it, and the depth a Back/Forward restore brings back is left alone. And the investigation chips were keyed by the label they display, which truncates a session id to 12 characters and a project to its last path segment: two chips that read alike collided into one React key, warned about it, and risked reconciling or removing the wrong one — they are now keyed by the full provider+id and project+branch identity the selection is deduplicated by. (#1317)
- **The menubar second row's quota line now names the provider the flame is warning about.** "Quota remaining" picked each provider's *headline* window — weekly, else monthly, and only then the busiest one — which is the Capacity Dock's billing horizon, not a warning: on a machine with Cursor's API window at 100% and Claude's 5-hour window at 18%, the row reported Monthly 9.5% and Weekly 5% and read as if nothing were near a limit. Each provider now contributes its worst window, per-model rows included, which is exactly what the menu-bar flame already tints by, so the two surfaces agree. A provider backing off after a failed fetch keeps its last-known window instead of dropping out, so the row no longer vanishes — resizing the status item — for the length of a retry, matching what the dock shows dimmed. The row is also capped at 24 characters, shortening a long provider name ("GitHub Copilot 12% left · 6d 3h") rather than letting the second line more than double the item's width, and the two-line title now carries a VoiceOver label that reads as one phrase instead of a string with a newline in it. With the setting off nothing changed: the snapshot that feeds the row is no longer even built on a refresh, and the title is the single-row composition it has always been. (#1310)
- **Every Copilot credential rung now follows its own GitHub host, not just the two read from files.** #1286 taught `hosts.json` and `apps.json` to carry the host their token came from, but the rungs that carried none — `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `gh auth token`, and a token pasted into Settings — were still sent to `api.github.com`, so a user whose only Copilot credential is a GitHub Enterprise Cloud login got a 401 and a terminal failure with no way out. The environment rung now reads `GH_HOST` from the same environment as the token; the `gh` rung resolves the host from gh's own `hosts.yml` (`GH_CONFIG_DIR`, then `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gh`, then `~/.config/gh`), picking it the way gh picks the host for `gh auth token` and without a second subprocess; and macOS Settings gains a GitHub host field next to the pasted token, defaulting to `github.com` and saved in the same Keychain record as the token so the two can never drift apart. Settings refuses a host no endpoint can be derived from at the field rather than storing it, the connection row no longer promises `api.github.com` before anything has been fetched, and every one of these new host sources is character-validated before a URL is built, so a crafted value such as `evil.com?.ghe.com` fails closed with no request instead of pointing the Authorization header at a host of its own choosing. `codeburn quota` is unchanged: it still reads only the editor-plugin files, which already carry their host. (#1306)
- **Copilot live quota works for GitHub Enterprise Cloud enterprises on a `*.ghe.com` host.** Both readers hardcoded `https://api.github.com/copilot_internal/user` and threw away the host their credential came from, so a data-residency enterprise signed in on `<tenant>.ghe.com` could only ever report `available: false` with "Temporarily unavailable". A discovered credential now carries its host — `hosts.json` is keyed by host and newer `apps.json` files key by `<host>:<app id>` — and the request follows it: `api.github.com` for `github.com` and for any rung that carries no host of its own (an app-name `apps.json` key, `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `gh auth token`, a pasted token), and `https://api.<tenant>.ghe.com/copilot_internal/user` for an enterprise host. The token and the host always come from the same entry, with `github.com` preferred when several hosts are signed in and otherwise the first `.ghe.com` tenant in sorted order; a host neither rule can address, such as a self-hosted GitHub Enterprise Server install, fails with a message naming that host instead of sending the credential to dotcom, and unreachable-host and HTTP failures name the host that was tried. The macOS Settings connection row now says which host answered. (#1286)
- **OpenCode's session-level fallback now bills reasoning tokens at the output rate.** When none of a session's messages produce a priced call, codeburn falls back to the totals on OpenCode's `session` row, and that path handed `tokens_output` alone to the pricing table while still reporting `tokens_reasoning` separately, so a reasoning model's thinking showed up in the token breakdown but was never charged (4,000 reasoning tokens on Sonnet 4 left a $0.11 session priced at $0.05). OpenCode itself charges reasoning at the output rate and codeburn's per-message path already did; the fallback and the per-message path now both go through `billableOutputTokens`, the same rule the cache-rehydration path uses, so the three can't drift apart again. Displayed token totals are unchanged. (#1334)

### Fixed (menubar)
- **A quota window that resets now refreshes now.** The menubar's 30s tick compared the reset times it already holds — Claude's 5-hour and weekly windows, Codex's two windows, every Capacity Dock provider's — against the previous tick, and forces a refresh for the provider whose window just rolled over instead of leaving the pre-reset percentage on screen for up to five minutes. Each reset instant fires once; everything else keeps the existing cadence.
- **The popover's quota warning can be read in light mode, and says which limit it is warning about.** The banner under the tagline painted its text in the same system yellow, orange or red as its 12% pill, so in light mode warning text measured 1.2:1 to 1.4:1 against the pill, and even red reached only 3.0:1; in dark mode red fell to 3.3:1. The pill keeps its hue, and the text and its glyph now take a per-appearance colour for each severity, a deep amber, rust or brick in light mode and a lifted orange or red in dark mode, that measures 5.3:1 or better everywhere. A test holds every severity at WCAG AA (4.5:1) against the pill composited over both ends of the popover's background in both appearances. The sentence also named no window. Its figure is the provider's worst window, so "Claude 70% of quota used" meant the 5-hour limit while Claude's own panel read weekly 34%, and it looked wrong. It now reads `Claude · 5-hour 71% · resets in 3h 12m`, with the countdown worded exactly as the Capacity Dock words it and one line per provider when several are warning. The countdown is left off when the provider reports no reset time or the reset has already passed. "Over limit" is kept for a window at or past 100%, where it used to cover anything from 90%. The flame's colour and the providers that trigger the banner are unchanged.

## 0.9.24 - 2026-09-04

### Added
- **The CLI now computes the anonymous usage aggregate the desktop app and the Windows tray send, so both report the identical shape.** `codeburn status --format menubar-json` gains a `telemetrySnapshot` block (schema 2) built by `src/telemetry-snapshot.ts` from the payload and its own turn-level reports. Its headline signal is the model x task cross: up to 8 models, each with a cost bucket, a turn bucket, a one-shot rate and up to 6 task categories with their share of that model's turns, alongside up to 12 task categories with their top models, providers, MCP servers, skills, tools, a session count and median-length bucket, and cache-hit and retry-tax shares. Every magnitude is a bucket label, never an exact dollar amount, count or duration, and every name is a model or configuration identifier: nothing in the block is derived from a working directory, project name, branch name, file path or message text. The desktop app sends the block verbatim as the once-daily `usage_snapshot` event when the CLI provides it and falls back to its own renderer-side builder for an older CLI, and it adds five name-only interaction events (`optimize_apply`, `plan_set`, `export`, `compare_view`, `settings_change`). Telemetry remains consent-gated behind the onboarding screen, off by default in the EU/EEA/UK/CH, and switchable at any time in Settings > Privacy & data; README documents exactly what each event carries. `STATUS_SNAPSHOT_VERSION` moves to 4 so persisted status snapshots re-derive with the new field.
- **Bundled pricing is refreshed for this release.** The primary LiteLLM snapshot moves from 4669 to 4739 models: 71 added, 1 removed (`azure_ai/deepseek-v4-flash-0731`, re-added under LiteLLM's new casing) and 18 repriced. The fallback table moves from 200 to 203 rows: 4 added (`claude-fable-5.1:batch`, `gemini-3.8-flash:batch`, `glm-flash-latest`), 1 removed and 4 repriced. Among models CodeBurn users actually run, `kimi-k2.5`, `kimi-k2.6` and their Azure rows plus `azure_ai/deepseek-v4-flash` and `azure_ai/deepseek-v4-pro` gain a cache-write price; `deepseek-v4-flash-0731` moves to $0.20 input and $0.40 output per million; `mistral-medium`, `magistral-medium-latest` and `magistral-small-latest` are repriced with a cache-write rate added; `Qwen/Qwen3.8-2.4T-A95B` drops to $2.00 input and $6.00 output per million with its cache-write rate halved; and `gpt-realtime-2` output rises from $16 to $24 per million. New rows of note are `gemini-3.8-flash`, `grok-build-latest`, `gpt-6-astra`, `glm-5p3-flash`, `azure_ai/kimi-k2.7-code` and the us-gov Bedrock Claude Opus 4.8 and Sonnet 5 rows. (#1254)
- **`codeburn quota` prints live capacity for every coding tool you are signed in to on this machine.** The new command lists each provider's quota windows as a table, or as machine-readable output with `--format json`. Ten adapters ship with it: Antigravity, Claude, ClinePass, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, Grok, Kimi and Z.ai. It landed together with the Windows Capacity Dock, which is its first consumer. (#1228)
- **A provider that records tokens but no dollar cost stays visible in the agent tabs.** The tabs filtered strictly on `cost > 0`, so Hermes on a flat subscription, free-tier models and any unpriced model vanished from the strip even though their usage existed. The menubar payload now carries a per-provider activity signal and the tab strip keys visibility off that instead: a provider with real usage stays listed at $0 recorded cost, while a provider merely discovered on disk stays hidden. The same rule is applied across the macOS menubar, the Electron renderer and the Windows payload, and an older payload without the signal keeps the previous detected-provider behaviour. (#1214) Thanks @MiguelMachado-dev.

### Added (macOS)
- **The Capacity Dock hover panel is now a glance card with running sessions, today's spend and every quota window.** The panel opens with the provider's logo, name and plan, then one pill per running session showing project and branch, model and elapsed time, context used and tokens left; the pill fills left to right to the context percentage in a severity tint, pills idle for more than two minutes dim, and the list scrolls past four. Below it a Today row reports what that provider burned with input, output and call count, and a column per quota window the provider reports gives the percent used, its label and the reset time, in four severity bands (yellow at 70, orange at 80, red at 90). Feeding it, `codeburn status --format menubar-json` gains an add-only `liveSessions` block covering sessions active in the last 10 minutes with model, branch, context tokens and window, start, last activity and `idleSeconds`, stripped by `sanitizeForSharing` and the MCP redactor, and costing about 115 ms warm on roughly 6900 transcripts. The Today figures are the hovered provider's, not the machine's: `providerDetails` entries gain optional `inputTokens`, `outputTokens` and `sessions` (absent rather than zero until a day reports them, `STATUS_SNAPSHOT_RENDER_VERSION` moves to 5), the section hides rather than borrow a global figure when the payload carries no breakdown, and a tile that stands for more than one CLI row now sums them, so Cursor covers `cursor` and `cursor-agent`, ClinePass covers `cline` and `cline-cli`, and Droid maps onto `droid`. The staleness line gets its own band with the same inset, padding and divider as every other block instead of sitting crammed under the header, and the panel now appears when a full-screen app is frontmost, where it had been ordered into a space you were not looking at and could be covered by any floating window. (#1237, #1246, #1247, #1249)
- **The macOS menubar can show your Grok Build quota.** A native adapter reads the Grok CLI's own `auth.json` under `$GROK_HOME` read-only, keeps the bearer token in memory for the request only over an ephemeral cookie-free session, and never copies the credential into CodeBurn storage. It offers the same single-click connection flow as the other local providers and surfaces plan, quota usage, reset timing and actionable connection errors. (#1222) Thanks @avs-io.
- **The macOS menubar can show your Z.ai Coding Plan quota.** A native adapter surfaces the 5-hour and weekly credit windows in Settings and the Capacity Dock, reusing an existing Pi Z.ai login read-only with a provider-scoped Keychain override as the fallback. A follow-up reads Z.ai's body-level `code` and `success` fields before parsing limits, so a rejected login is reported as an authentication error rather than a parse failure when the HTTP status is 200 but the body carries 401 or 403. (#1202, #1204) Thanks @MiguelMachado-dev.
- **The macOS menubar can show your Cursor quota.** A CodeBurn-owned adapter discovers the existing Cursor app session in one click, reads Cursor's state SQLite read-only with a WAL-aware immutable fallback, validates the local token's subject and expiry, and keeps the token in memory only with no CodeBurn Keychain copy and no dependency on another provider's runtime. Monthly, Auto, API, on-demand and team-pool usage are normalized for the Capacity Dock, and Cursor appears as a live provider in Settings. (#1174) Thanks @avs-io.
- **The Capacity Dock size slider goes down to 60 percent.** The lower bound moves from 70 to 60 percent in the same 5-point steps, and a persisted value below the old bound clamps to the new one. (#1209)

### Added (Windows)
- **Windows gets a Capacity Dock, the edge-docked quota rail the macOS menubar has.** A second frameless, transparent, always-on-top window rests against a screen edge with one capacity ring per provider reporting `available: true`; hovering widens the same window into a detail panel listing every quota window per provider with its label, percent used, plan and reset countdown, and the glance bubble from the macOS dock is there too. The dock drags and snaps to any of the four edges, slides in and out from the edge, persists its placement, and has settings for scale, edge, shades and gauge shape. Data comes from `codeburn quota --format json`, refreshed every five minutes and on demand by double-clicking the rail; a CLI too old to have the `quota` subcommand shows a quiet "CLI update needed" line instead of an error storm. The tray menu gains a "Show Capacity Dock" checkbox, off by default and persisted to `~/.config/codeburn/windows-dock.json`, and switching it off closes the window outright rather than leaving a hidden live view running. The desktop app bundles and installs the tray MSI, owns the Menu bar and Sidebar switches in its bottom-left corner, shows the tray's Menu bar and Capacity Dock settings when they are on, and lists Plugins as coming soon on Windows; the Store route ships the tray exe inside the AppX. A second launch of the tray app could also deadlock it during startup and leave every later launch, `--quit` included, stuck as a windowless process; the single-instance callback now defers to the event loop and the desktop app waits for a quit to finish before relaunching. Verified on a Windows 11 ARM64 VM with installed release builds; multi-monitor and mixed-DPI behaviour is unverified on that single-display machine. (#1228)

### Changed
- **The Linux snap now asks for only the paths its parsers actually open, and one credential file moved off the automatic grant.** `$HOME/.claude/.credentials.json` leaves the auto-connect `ai-agent-session-logs` plug and becomes its own read-only single-file `claude-quota-credentials` plug with no auto-connect requested, so the optional Claude plan and quota tile now needs `snap connect codeburn:claude-quota-credentials` once; it already degrades gracefully when the file is unreadable. `~/.config/github-copilot` is removed entirely because it holds the Copilot OAuth credential files, so JetBrains Copilot sessions are not discovered under the snap, which `docs/providers/copilot.md` now says. `GitHub.copilot-chat` was capitalised and matched nothing on a case-sensitive filesystem; it is corrected to lowercase and joined by the Code - Insiders and VSCodium variants. Grants are narrowed to what is read (`~/.cline/data` to its `tasks` subdirectory, `.omp/agent` and `.pi/agent` to their `sessions` subdirectories so `.pi/agent/auth.json` is no longer covered, `.cursor/ai-tracking` to `ai-code-tracking.db`, the claude-dev, roo-cline and kilo-code global storage entries to their `tasks` subdirectories, and the Antigravity roots to the five directories the parser reads) and added where a parser reads a path that was never granted, including Cline sessions, the clawdbot, moltbot and moldbot agent directories, Cursor `workspaceStorage`, `~/.copilot/session-store.db`, IBM Bob, lingtai and zerostack. `app/scripts/snap-grants.test.ts` enforces the shape, including that no credential path appears in the auto-connect plug. On the CI side, `snapcraft upload` exits non-zero whenever the store answers "will need manual review", which every personal-files snap gets, so the publish job now treats that answer as a successful upload while any other failure still fails. (#1195, #1223, #1224)

### Fixed
- **Hermes sessions on a flat subscription stop reporting $0.00, and provider totals stop leaking stale or false-zero figures into the menubar.** Hermes writes `estimated_cost_usd = 0.0` rather than NULL when its `cost_status` is `unknown` or `included`, and any non-null estimate was treated as a recorded amount, so the placeholder zero beat the token-based calculation forever; only a positive recorded estimate is trusted now, a zero falls through to the calculation, and a non-null `actual_cost_usd` still wins including an explicit $0. Around that, `providerDetails.hasUsage` becomes authoritative and fails closed for legacy payloads, provider history and cache are scoped to active provider periods so a stale provider cannot contribute a false zero, Hermes measured and estimated provenance is preserved through a version 3 session ledger with migration handling, provider paging arrows stay navigational, and versioned Claude family labels are derived so an observed id such as `claude-fable-5-1` displays as `Fable 5.1` without a hand-maintained entry. The refresh path snapshots its cache keys atomically and joins an all-provider refresh already in flight instead of launching competing work, and reconciles cost and call mismatches independently rather than accepting a partially stale payload. `DAILY_CACHE_VERSION` moves to 31, so settled days re-derive once on the first run after upgrading and then stay cached, and the upgrade-path check discovers the derived version instead of hard-coding one that drifts at every accounting bump. (#1213, #1234, #1235) Thanks @MiguelMachado-dev and @avs-io.
- **The desktop Trend and Spend charts group models the same way `codeburn models` does.** The per-day rows behind those charts were built from the raw provider and model string while `codeburn models` merged by alias-resolved canonical id, so the same day's data produced two different ideas of what counts as one model: the Trend tooltip listed `minimax/MiniMax-M3` and `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` as separate rows against a single "MiniMax M3" row in the command. `history.daily[].topModels` now merges by the same normalized display name, and a merged row carries a new optional `rawModels` field so a cached and an uncached route stay visible; `codeburn models` gains the same field in its JSON, and the desktop tooltip appends the route list when more than one raw id fed a segment. Both changes are add-only to the CLI and app payload contract. Fixes #1239. (#1241)
- **`codeburn plan` estimates Copilot AI credits and says when the total is incomplete instead of printing a confident wrong number.** Only the Copilot CLI's `~/.copilot/session-store.db` rows carry an exact credit figure, so VS Code chat sessions, transcripts, the OTel database, JetBrains stores and the CLI session-state JSONL contributed nothing: the headline could read `3.9 / 20000 AI Credits` while GitHub showed 19,326. Requests without an exact figure are now estimated from tokens at the model's listed API rate with 1 credit equal to $0.01, which is how GitHub bills credits including the cache-read and cache-write split, and the headline says so whenever anything is estimated, for example `Copilot Max: ~9800 / 20000 AI Credits (estimated; 4 of 473 requests carry GitHub's exact figure)`. The bar and `percentUsed` follow the estimate while any request is unrated and the exact figure once every request carries one, and a session that carries any exact figure is never estimated on top of, so paired store rows and JSONL twins cannot double count. New add-only plan fields are `estimatedCredits`, `creditRatedCalls`, `creditUnratedCalls` and `creditsNote`; `docs/providers/copilot.md` documents which sources carry exact credits. Fixes #1199. (#1201)

### Fixed (menubar)
- **The macOS menubar app no longer burns 5 to 7 percent CPU while sitting idle.** Activity Monitor had it at roughly two thirds of Chrome's daily energy on the same machine, with about 650 wakeups a second and nothing on screen. Three causes are fixed. The status-item popover's hosting controller lived for the app's lifetime with the wordmark's repeating gradient sweep and the loading pulse inside it, so the closed, invisible popover re-rendered at display cadence; those animations now start when the popover appears and stop when it closes, and the popover's content view is built fresh on every open and released on close so nothing survives to churn. Every scaled Capacity Dock dimension is rounded to a whole point, because at any dock scale other than 100 percent the fractional sizes made SwiftUI's fitted content disagree with the pixel-aligned frame and re-run layout forever. And the dock's bubble panel is released on dismiss and rebuilt on the next hover rather than kept alive hidden. Measured on the same machine, idle CPU goes from 5 to 7 percent sustained to 0.1 percent, including the case that reproduced it most reliably, opening the popover during the first data load. (#1208, #1210, #1220)
- **Copilot quota is found when you are signed in through the Copilot CLI or `gh` rather than the legacy editor plugin files.** The ring only looked for `~/.config/github-copilot/hosts.json` and `apps.json`, which only older plugins write, so a fully signed-in user saw "No GitHub Copilot credentials found" with no hint that usage tracking was unaffected. Discovery is now a read-only chain, first hit wins and every rung tolerant of missing or malformed data: those two files, then `~/.copilot/config.json` and `settings.json` (taking the first value with a GitHub access-token prefix and skipping `ghr_` refresh tokens), then `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`, then `gh auth token` cached for five minutes behind a 5 second deadline and never on the main thread, then a token pasted in Settings and kept in CodeBurn's own provider-scoped keychain item. The Copilot CLI's own Keychain item is deliberately not read because every read would raise the macOS access dialog, and VS Code's encrypted secret storage stays out of scope. The message now reads "No GitHub Copilot credentials found. Usage tracking still works." followed by the three ways to connect. Separately, a Free or Individual plan reports a `premium_interactions` window with entitlement 0, which both the menubar and the desktop decoder had drawn as a 100 percent used ring; windows with entitlement 0 or `unlimited: true` are now skipped in both readers. Fixes #1198. (#1200)
- **Grok unified-billing accounts show 0 percent after a weekly reset instead of an unrecognized-payload error, and only those accounts do.** SuperGrok Heavy unified billing drops `creditUsagePercent` from its billing response after a weekly reset, and treating that as an unrecognized payload showed no usage where grok.com showed 0 percent, so an omitted percent inside an active billing period is now read as 0 percent used, matching Grok's own client; a published percent or a usable used-over-cap ratio still wins, and an expired window without a percent is never invented as 0. That rule is then scoped to unified-billing accounts only, since it had applied to any account with an open window; everyone else falls back to unknown as before. (#1242, #1253) Thanks @mh7whmyz6z-alt.
- **The CodeBurn wordmark stops vanishing from the popover header.** The letters were drawn hidden and made visible only through an animated gradient masked by their shapes, so any frame where the mask or the gradient frame was not laid out yet, such as the first frame after opening or an animation retargeting on reopen, showed nothing at all. The letters now carry a static flame gradient fill of their own and the sweep is an overlay that can only brighten them, slowed from 1.5 s to 4 s each way. (#1240)
- **Checking whether a provider's credentials are present can no longer deadlock the app.** The presence check and the credential store's mutation path took the same lock in opposite order; the acquisition order is now consistent so a presence read never waits on the write path. (#1212) Thanks @MiguelMachado-dev.
- **The Capacity Dock stops drifting out of position as you hover it.** `NSHostingView` intrinsic window resizing is disabled for the rail and detail panels so AppKit is the sole owner of their geometry, and SwiftUI content-size updates can no longer race the hover frame animations and accumulate a position offset. (#1205) Thanks @MiguelMachado-dev.
- **Capacity Dock hover works over any frontmost app, not just Chrome.** Hover was synthesized from a global mouse-moved monitor, and macOS only delivers those events while the frontmost application itself requests them, so hovering was dead over the Finder desktop or Terminal. A 10 Hz pointer poll on the main run loop now feeds the same passthrough and hover path the monitors use, with a same-position guard that makes idle ticks free and a lifecycle tied to the existing monitors so a disabled dock costs nothing. (#1197)

### Fixed (Windows)
- **A Codex quota refresh can no longer overwrite a login that changed while it was in flight, and the tray and desktop apps stop losing each other's settings writes.** A quota read refreshes the Codex token and writes the rotated one back; if you signed in as someone else, or signed out and in again, while that request was outstanding, the response belonged to the old login and overwrote the new credentials. The refresh now checks the account id, the refresh token it started from and the id-token subject before writing, and discards the response if any of them moved, in both copies of the reader. Separately the Rust tray app and the Node desktop app both write the same preference files, so a read-modify-write from two processes lost updates and a torn read parsed as `{}`, silently collapsing every dock setting to its default; one cross-process lock now covers all three write sites on both sides, including the dock's enabled, provider and placement writes. The cross-process test was proven to fail without the lock, and was later reduced from 100 rounds a side to 24 so that it stops starving itself against the production 2 second lock budget on a loaded CI runner, and it still catches a lost update as reliably as before. (#1248, #1251)

### Internal
- **A repeatable performance harness with baselines pinned to main.** An isolated-HOME fixture generator and metric runner (`npm run perf:all`) measure wait-path latency through the same CLI and `serve` arguments the desktop app and menubar already use: cold session parse, incremental reparse, first and warm period switches, cold-start wait paths, refresh and view-switch proxies, and RSS after a cold load. Baselines for each are pinned in `perf/BASELINES.md` against a 28 MB synthetic fixture, no product hot path is touched, and the generator refuses to write under a real home. (#1173) Thanks @avs-io.
- **Release builds are hermetic.** The live LiteLLM update no longer runs as part of the release build path, the dashboard release build uses `npm ci`, and the reproducible-build contract is documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and pinned by tests. (#1236) Thanks @avs-io.
- **The cache-refresh lock heartbeat writes atomically, ending a long-running JSON flake.** The heartbeat rewrote the lock file in place, so a concurrent reader could see an empty or partial body and fail with `Unexpected end of JSON input`. It now writes the next body beside the lock and renames over it, which is atomic on POSIX and a replacing move on Windows; a refused replace skips the tick and cleans up, absorbed by the nine-heartbeat staleness window. A new regression test doing 400 plain reads against a 1 ms heartbeat fails on the old code every run and passes with the fix. (#1196)
- **Real people and machines are scrubbed out of the test fixtures and docs.** An audit of every commit since v0.9.23 found no credentials, hosts, customer data or committed logs, and five places where a real value stood in for an invented one: an absolute path into a private audit workspace and a personal detail in `perf/README.md`, a private product name as a fixture working directory, and the maintainer's OS username and two machine names inside tests that assert such strings are redacted. Every change is a rename, no assertion is weakened, and a device name that survived in `codeburn-desktop-wireframes.html` was caught in a follow-up. (#1250, #1253)
- **Maintainer docs match the tree again.** The provider registry gains the missing Codebuff, Mux, Open Design and Zed rows with new pages for Codebuff and Open Design derived from their parsers, Gemini and Antigravity point at their real test files, the architecture page's eager provider list and test inventory are corrected, the Gemini page's described parsing behaviour is corrected, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` stops hard-coding a test-case count that rots on every PR and names the commands that actually work as the full-suite gate. (#1221)
- **Contributing rules for the full-suite gate, agent accountability and affiliation disclosure.** Verification means the full suite on your branch against main with zero new failures, contributors answer posted review findings before opening more PRs and are accountable for what their agent submits, and a new-provider PR must disclose affiliation with the tool being added. (#1194)
- **A budget test no longer fails on every branch when CI runs before noon UTC.** It seeded the current month's spend at today 12:00 UTC, which is in the future for any run between 00:00 and 12:00, and future-dated rows never surface in the overview, so the budget line never rendered. It now seeds five minutes in the past, pinned to the month start on the 1st. (#1216) Thanks @MiguelMachado-dev.
- **Two payload comparisons ignore the wall-clock fields the new `liveSessions` block carries.** The menubar parity test builds the payload twice over one warm cache and expects a match, and `idleSeconds` differs by one across a second boundary, so `stableShape` now zeroes it the way it already blanks the `generated` stamp. The upgrade-path check comparing a payload built with and without workers strips `liveSessions` outright, since `idleSeconds` and `lastActivityAt` differ between the two invocations by design. (#1238, #1245)
- **An overridden Claude home is a strict credential-source boundary.** Isolated tests and sandboxed probes no longer fall through to the operator's login Keychain, while normal file-then-Keychain discovery is unchanged when no override is active. (#1172) Thanks @avs-io.

## 0.9.23 - 2026-08-29

### Added
- **`codeburn sync push` sends additive CB-3 usage-span fields from the Teams boundary spec section 7.** Every new attribute is optional and emitted only when its value is proven, so a receiver ignoring unknown attributes loses nothing. Sessions with provider-recorded lineage (the #1140 field) now carry `ai.work_unit_id` (deriveTraceId of the root session, the same derivation trace ids already use, resolved by the #1145 work-unit resolver), `ai.session_role` (root|child), and `ai.lineage_evidence` (provider-recorded) - all three or none, never inferred, and a child whose parent is out of range, ambiguous, or cyclic fails closed with none of the three. Cache tokens ride as `ai.cache_read_tokens` / `ai.cache_write_tokens`, billable-consistent with `ai.input_tokens` via the display layer's max-of-both-vocabularies convention, each sent only when non-zero. `ai.call_count` and `ai.session_duration_ms` describe the span's session (span count, and last-minus-first provider-recorded event time, omitted when either timestamp is missing or unordered). `ai.subscription_covered` reports the plan/proxy-path machinery's decision and is omitted when it cannot decide (no plan match and no cwd to proxy-check). Each export batch also carries a `codeburn.coverage_through` resource attribute with the ISO date the local corpus is complete through, stamped only when a complete parse finalized the daily-cache watermark. Span ids, trace ids, and ledger keys are unchanged, so nothing re-sends; new string values pass the same #1128 serialization sanitizers, with the lineage trio falling together if any value fails. `sync push --dry-run` stays zero-push and now reports how many spans carry lineage, cache tokens, and each subscription_covered verdict plus the coverage watermark, and the field disclosure in docs/sync/README.md (which also back-fills the previously undocumented `ai.speed` and `ai.cost_estimated`) and docs/sync/DEVELOPER.md lists every new attribute. Implements slice CB-3 of the CodeBurn main/Teams boundary spec (CODEBURN-MAIN-TEAMS-BOUNDARY-v0.1). (#1135, #1140)
- **`codeburn sync auto` adds opt-in, consent-once automatic sync that never sends until you accept.** `sync auto enable --cadence daily|hourly [--attribution] [--accept]` first prints the full plain-language disclosure - every outbound field carries a written meaning, pinned by a test asserting the meanings map covers `CORE_SYNC_ATTRIBUTE_KEYS` exactly - and without `--accept` stores nothing at all. Acceptance is recorded as a sha256 fingerprint over the org, destination, wire contract version, the sorted outbound field set, your work-matching choice, a 7-day scan scope, and the cadence; enable, run, and status build that input through one shared function so they can never disagree. The scheduler-invoked `sync auto run` sends only on an exact fingerprint match through the same push path as manual `sync push` (attribution included when and only when it was accepted); if the config is killed or was never accepted it writes a receipt and makes zero network calls, and if the accepted terms have since drifted it writes an acceptance-required receipt and again sends nothing until you re-accept. `sync auto disable` is a hard kill switch: it removes the scheduled job and stops all automatic outbound immediately, leaving manual `sync push` untouched. Every automatic attempt - sent, skipped, killed, or drift-blocked - is recorded as an append-only JSONL receipt beside the sync config. macOS installs a LaunchAgent; other platforms print a crontab line to add. Implements slice CB-4 of the CodeBurn main/Teams boundary spec (CODEBURN-MAIN-TEAMS-BOUNDARY-v0.1). (#1153)

### Added (macOS)
- **The macOS menubar gains a native Capacity Dock - an optional floating usage widget that rests against any screen edge.** It sits collapsed on a single provider and expands on hover or click into per-provider quota rings, opening its usage details inward from whichever screen edge it is docked to, and drags across edges with surface-tension shoulders, usable-screen recovery, and shape-aware click-through. Each ring reads a provider's quota - the weekly window when there is one, otherwise the monthly - as a headline gauge whose colour shifts by severity as it fills (green below 50%, then yellow, orange, and red), with plan labels and inline hide/connect actions. Connected subscriptions surface themselves automatically, up to five, until you curate the set yourself, after which your choice is kept. It ships Graphite and Liquid Glass appearances and circle or squircle gauges, with Apple-system typography, warm off-white text, reduced-motion behaviour, and VoiceOver labels. Provider credentials stay provider-scoped in CodeBurn-owned Keychain accounts, and catalog entries without a live quota adapter stay informational and can never claim a connection. (#1167)

### Fixed
- **OMP-provider rows now respect the period filter, attribute cost correctly, and price Grok 4.6 at its high tier.** `codeburn models -p <period>` had returned an identical OMP aggregate at every scope because the session-header branch dropped its timestamp, so an absent `entry.timestamp` handed the range filter an invalid date and the `today` row reflected a cumulative rather than a daily total; timestamps are now retained for date slicing. A valid alias plus price override had still produced a zero-cost OMP row because any finite `msg.usage.cost.total` was treated as authoritative and OMP writes `cost.total = 0` for `xai-oauth` ids; a zero reported cost is now treated as absent and repriced through the alias table and overrides, while a nonzero reported cost keeps its existing behaviour. And Grok 4.6, which xAI prices in two tiers, gains its 200k prompt-token tier ($4.00 / $1.00 cached / $12.00 output, applied to every token in a request once prompt tokens - input plus cached input - reach 200,000 inclusively), where the bundled card had carried only the low tier and under-reported large-context traffic; an exact configured `priceOverrides` entry still wins over the built-in tier. `CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION` moves to 3 so cached rendered costs recompute. (#1150)

### Fixed (desktop)
- **The desktop app paints the last exact totals immediately while the selected period refreshes.** On a large corpus, switching Today / 7D / 30D / Month / 6M / Life could make the app feel frozen while it rehydrated every detailed panel, and it could briefly show the previous period's total. It now paints the last exact cached headline at once with honest progress copy and drill-down skeletons behind it, pre-warms the standard horizons without a provider-by-period parse storm, and keys data, errors, and late responses to the selected period/provider so a total can never leak across filters. Partial resident hydration is rejected as an exact snapshot, boundary-sensitive Today/Month keys stay current, the session memo is capped at 96 LRU entries so date-boundary keys cannot grow forever, and progressive data is invalidated safely after configuration changes. Long activity timelines read better too: fixed weekday labels, month labels aligned to the scrolling heatmap, newest dates first, and readable long daily-spend labels. (#1157)
- **Every desktop destination stays useful across restarts instead of greeting you with a blank skeleton.** Sessions, Spend, Optimize, Models, Compare, and Plans now persist versioned, compressed report snapshots per destination and paint the last exact same-key (period/provider/range) result immediately on a renderer restart, labelled as cached, then revalidate once. The in-memory LRU is bounded by both count (96) and serialized weight (12M characters) and durable storage to 72 snapshots, restart persistence is pre-capped at 300k raw JSON characters so multi-megabyte reports are never synchronously compressed on the renderer thread, and recompression and writes are skipped when a poll returns an unchanged report. Stale and partially hydrated results are rejected from restart persistence while still retained as last-good data in the live renderer, Today and Month snapshots are keyed to local calendar boundaries so yesterday's answer cannot appear under today's label, and horizons warm serially at background priority (Today to 7D to 30D to Month to 6M to Life) while normal Chromium background throttling is preserved. Quota endpoint discovery stays user-driven (opening Plans), report generations are invalidated after settings changes, and the footer now describes the selected destination and ages old snapshots in hours/days. Renderer storage contains report output only. (#1163)
- **The packaged desktop CLI recovers safely when its resident stdio child dies and no longer misroutes ordinary commands.** When resident stdin closes the app now detaches the dead child and falls back to one-shot execution rather than turning a closed pipe into an `EPIPE` failure, and the generated Electron-as-Node launcher preserves `serve --stdio` dispatch without swallowing ordinary CLI arguments. The packaging gate now proves both an ordinary CLI command and a held-open resident ready handshake, running the packaged resident smoke under a disposable HOME/data/cache tree so packaging can never arm watchers against a developer's real corpus. (#1155)
- **Quitting CodeBurn reaps the resident CLI's whole process tree instead of leaking it.** Release testing found live `codeburn serve --stdio` processes reparented to PID 1 after earlier runs, because a direct child-only signal cannot reach a provider parser or other grandchild - which could also strand owned cache locks. The resident CLI is now launched in its own POSIX process group and the complete owned group is terminated on normal quit (`SIGTERM`, then a bounded `SIGKILL` fallback) within Electron's existing `before-quit` window, with process-group ownership recorded in the serve PID file so a stale owned resident can be reaped safely. The grace period is short and bounded (750 ms cooperative plus 250 ms post-kill, inside the existing 1.5 s quit deadline); Windows retains direct-child termination since POSIX process groups are unavailable there. (#1166)

### Fixed (TUI)
- **The interactive TUI is useful before a large corpus has finished re-indexing.** It now paints an exact cached period first, clearly labelled as cached while source refresh continues, making Today, 7D, 30D, Month, 6M, and Lifetime immediately selectable from one normalized cached index, then stages cold-cache readiness in that order while parsing source contents once. Today falls back to 7D only when Today is exactly empty across calls, cost, savings, and tokens - unpriced or token-only activity keeps Today - and provider and period truth are preserved across rapid navigation, custom ranges, day mode, and in-flight reloads. Cached snapshots are kept out of the parse memo and the index is replaced atomically after reconciliation, and real `q` and `Ctrl-C` termination are preserved. On one heavy corpus first-visible dropped from a median of about 26s to about 3s. (#1159)
- **Rapidly resizing the terminal no longer leaves ghost panels below the frame.** Resizing between wide and narrow layouts could leave pixels from the old dashboard under the newly rendered one, looking like duplicated panels even though the live layout was correct. Resize bursts are now coalesced and the stale viewport is cleared before the settled redraw, with one redraw forced even when Ink considers the next frame textually unchanged. The clear/redraw path stays disabled in screen-reader mode so accessible text is never erased. (#1156)
- **The TUI releases its cache locks on a confirmed exit.** Both cache-lock families are now released before the TUI's direct process exit, so a `hydrating.lock` (and its sibling) can no longer be left behind after quit, while the existing first-`q` confirmation and second-`q` fast exit during indexing are preserved and the terminal is fully restored (raw mode, mouse tracking, and the alternate screen all off). Exit status is conventional: 130 for `Ctrl-C`, 0 for `q`. (#1165)

### Fixed (menubar)
- **The macOS menubar recovers its status item when Tahoe parks it.** The existing status item is given a stable AppKit autosave identity, and only the confirmed Tahoe parked geometry is detected; when the menu bar is revealed the app recovers with at most three supported visibility pulses and never removes or recreates the status item. (#1161)

## 0.9.22 - 2026-08-25

### Added
- **`codeburn sessions --by-work-unit` groups the sessions report into provider-recorded work units.** The new deterministic resolver (`src/work-units.ts`) folds each session carrying the #1140 `lineage` field under the orchestration root it names, giving one row per unit with the root's title and project, cost/calls summed over root plus children, and a child count, with the children listed indented beneath and standalone sessions rendered exactly as before. A work unit's id is `deriveTraceId(rootSessionId)`, the exact trace-id derivation sync already uses, so a unit's identity matches the root's existing trace identity. Evidence stays strictly provider-recorded: a session without lineage is its own standalone unit with role `unknown`, a child that names an in-range parent folds even when the parent recorded nothing (one-sided evidence), and anything ambiguous fails closed per the boundary spec's MAIN-02 - a parent id outside the parsed window leaves the child ungrouped, cycles and self-references are broken and marked `unknown`, and duplicate or cross-provider id collisions never fold. `--format json` with the flag emits an add-only `{ sessions, workUnits }` envelope: `sessions` is today's row array unchanged, `workUnits` is the resolver's full partition (standalone sessions included, so counts and totals reconcile). Default output without the flag is byte-identical, no wire/sync or daily-cache behavior changes, and a pinning test asserts the grouped footer total equals the ungrouped total. Implements slice CB-2 of the CodeBurn main/Teams boundary spec (CODEBURN-MAIN-TEAMS-BOUNDARY-v0.1). (#1140)
- **`codeburn status --format menubar-json` can serve from a disk-persisted snapshot.** A background poll whose corpus has not changed since the last computation is answered from a per-query snapshot keyed on a corpus fingerprint (ordered source topology, per-provider env fingerprints, five config hashes, currency, pricing generation, cache and package versions - any mismatch is a miss), eliminating the per-poll re-parse on idle machines. A snapshot is only ever written for a complete, non-degraded parse: the save gate requires the payload's own captured markers (`stale !== true`, no `hydration` block), so a poll that went read-only under a held refresh lock can never pin its under-reported totals to disk - a regression holds the refresh lock and asserts no snapshot file is written. Serve-side and one-shot outputs are unchanged; the optimization currently engages for `--no-optimize` polls (the menubar background refresh). Thanks @dgabehar, hardening @ozymandiashh. (#999)
- **The menubar status snapshot now re-validates persisted records on load, mirroring the save gate.** A snapshot record whose payload carries degradation markers (`stale: true` or a `hydration` block) is treated as a miss and recomputed instead of served, so a record that should never have been written (older build, hand-edited file) can never pin under-reported totals; the save gate from #999 is unchanged. Extending the snapshot to the default optimize path was evaluated on this branch and reverted in post-build review: `scanAndDetect`'s findings depend on mutable state the corpus fingerprint never observes (`~/.claude` and project-level `settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, defined skills, agents, commands, MCP config), and re-deriving them on a snapshot hit requires the parsed corpus, which is the full parse the snapshot exists to avoid on exactly the cold processes it serves. The optimize path therefore still never reads or writes the disk snapshot, and one-shot and serve-child outputs are byte-identical to before for both optimize values. (#1135)
- **The parser captures provider-recorded session lineage instead of discarding it.** Claude agent transcripts carry a provider-written parent session reference (and the parent side records the spawned agent id when compaction has not dropped it); Kimi Code subagent sessions live inside their parent session's own directory. Both now populate an optional `lineage` field on the parsed session model - `parentSessionId`, a root/child role, and `evidence: 'provider-recorded'` - persisted through the session cache, with claude and kimicode parse versions bumped for the one-time re-derive. Strictly provider-recorded evidence only: no inference from time adjacency or shared projects, and a session with no evidence carries no lineage field at all. Purely additive metadata: a pinning test asserts every report total is byte-identical with the field present or absent. Groundwork for spend attribution across delegated-agent families (a measured 5.1% of sessions carry direct lineage but 76% of 90-day spend). (#1140)

### Fixed (macOS)

- **CodeBurnMenubar now launches mise-installed CodeBurn correctly from Spotlight.** Spotlight gives GUI apps a minimal PATH, so a persisted `mise use -g npm:codeburn` launcher could be found but then fail with exit 127 when its shell wrapper tried to resolve `node`. The menubar child environment now includes mise's stable shim directory (including a custom `MISE_DATA_DIR` when available), matching the existing Volta/asdf/nvm handling without invoking a shell. (#1124)

### Fixed (TUI)

- **The interactive dashboard stays responsive during the cold-start background fill, and `Ctrl+C` exits the TUI at any moment after paint.** The progressive cold start introduced by #1109 paints the dashboard from recent files, then runs a background fill that parses the deferred history and writes the per-file session cache. On a real 21k-file corpus that fill's cache save publishes one JSON.stringify + fsync per provider shard in a tight loop, and the whole save held the event loop long enough that Ink's stdin reader never ran - a `q` or `Ctrl+C` pressed in the post-paint window was swallowed, not buffered, and the user saw a frozen terminal (#1139, #1141). `saveCache` now yields to the event loop between every shard write, so the Ink input handler fires between publishes. The yield sits BETWEEN shards, never inside one, so each shard's temp+rename atomicity and the lost-fence cleanup that owns the canonical envelope are preserved; nothing marked seen without being parsed, the kill-safe resume invariant from #1109 is intact, and the floored-parse memo key suffix keeps warm reads byte-identical. The fill still parses every deferred file, so money totals are unchanged. The dashboard's `useInput` now exits on `Ctrl+C` through the same path as `q`, so a raw 0x03 from the terminal lands as soon as the loop breathes. Pinning tests: `tests/save-cache-yields.test.ts` (a `setImmediate` probe must interleave with `saveCache`'s shard writes) and `tests/dashboard-exit.test.ts` (a raw `\x03` exits the dashboard the same way `q` does). The #1109 cold-start one-shots - report, sessions, models, json/csv/markdown, the desktop and menubar payloads - are unchanged.
- **The first `q` during the cold-start background fill renders feedback instead of a silent drain, and a second `q` exits the same way `Ctrl+C` does.** With the #1142 input fix in place, `q` pressed during the post-paint fill landed instantly but the exit path drained the fill first - a deterministic ~16.5s silent wait on a 21k-file corpus (#1143). The fill's indexing signal already flows to the dashboard (the #1109 banner reuses it), so the `useInput` handler now arms a confirmation on the first `q` while a fill is active and renders `Finishing background index so the next launch starts warm - press q or Ctrl+C again to quit now` in the footer area, with the second `q` taking the abrupt path. `Ctrl+C` is unchanged: it always exits through the abrupt path, and because #1109 made that path kill-safe (nothing marked seen without being parsed, resume converges) the two are equivalent. When the fill completes, the confirmation clears itself so a later `q` cannot be trapped by a stale flag. `q` with no fill active exits immediately as before, with no status-line flicker. Pinning tests added to `tests/dashboard-exit.test.ts`.

## 0.9.21 - 2026-08-24

### Added
- **Copilot AI Credit plans.** `codeburn plan set copilot-pro` (1,500 credits / $15 equivalent, not the $10 sticker), `copilot-pro-plus` (7,000), `copilot-max` (20,000), and `custom --credits N --provider copilot`. Spend is `sum(finite nanoAiu) / 1e9`. Token-priced `costUSD` does not fill the credits bar. Claude / cursor / grok / custom-USD plans stay on `costUSD`. (#943)
- **`codeburn models --unpriced`.** The dashboard warns about models that price at $0 and points at `codeburn model-alias`, but the list itself was hard to get out of the TUI. This filters the plain-stdout `models` report to exactly those rows, reusing `findUnpricedModels` so local, free, aliased and price-overridden models are treated the same way the warning treats them, and defaulting that mode's min-cost to 0 so $0 rows are not pre-filtered away. Thanks @kocaemre. (#969)
- **`optimize` spots the same long block pasted at the start of many sessions.** The new `recurring-context` detector groups sessions by their opening block - normalized for whitespace and ANSI, hashed over the first 2 KB - and reports a block of at least 1.5 KB that opens 5 or more sessions, with the top three by tokens, their session counts and the project each is confined to. It is a habit, not an apply-able fix: CodeBurn will not move your own text into `CLAUDE.md` for you, so the finding asks Claude to give the block a permanent home (a `CLAUDE.md` rule, or a file read on demand) and hand back a one-line pointer to open sessions with instead. Savings count the repeats only, never the first paste, and are marked `estimated`: provider usage is counted per API call, where the pasted block is mixed in with the system prompt, tool schemas and `CLAUDE.md`, so the block is sized from its own bytes. Injected system reminders and slash-command wrappers are not pastes and are skipped, and neither is a prompt a program wrote - an SDK session or a subagent task - read from the entry's flags, which survive the parser's large-line path. The opening block comes from the session scan that already runs, so nothing extra is read from disk.
- **Applied fixes get re-measured on every `optimize` run, and told plainly whether they worked.** After `codeburn optimize --apply`, every still-applied fix comes back in an `Applied fixes` section on subsequent `codeburn optimize` runs, carrying the verdict `act report` already computes from the same reconciliation: `worked` (at least 70% of its window-scaled estimate realized), `partial` (something, but under that), `no-effect` (no measured reduction, printed with the exact `codeburn act undo <id>` that puts it back), or `measuring` for anything younger than the 3-day measurement window. The numbers are measured - provider-counted usage over the post-apply window - not re-estimated. `--apply` now says when the re-measure will happen, `--format json` gains `appliedFixes[]` (add-only), and the same section appears in the dashboard TUI and the desktop app. New `codeburn optimize --auto-revert` undoes the fixes that measured no reduction at all through the same code path as `codeburn act undo`; it never touches `partial` or still-measuring fixes, and never auto-reverts a `CLAUDE.md` rule (it prints the undo command instead), matching the `--yes` guardrail.
- **Optimize findings say what to do with them and where their number came from.** Every finding now carries a class and a basis, and every surface groups by it: `Fix now (apply-able)` for findings `codeburn optimize --apply` can write itself, `Habits` for the behavioural ones, `FYI` for informational ones whose cost may be justified. A finding only counts as apply-able when a plan can actually be built for that instance, so an `mcp-deferral-off` caused by Vertex policy or a shell-profile override is grouped as a habit rather than promising a fix that does not exist. Alongside it, each finding is marked `measured` (summed from provider-counted usage) or `estimated` (a schema-size or recovery-fraction model), with the split reported in the header as `N measured · M estimated` in place of the blanket "Estimates only." footer. Sessions whose cost the provider never reported are kept out of the `cost-outliers` peer comparison, and a provider that only ever estimates gets the finding marked `estimated` rather than dropped. `--format json` gains `class` and `basis` per finding plus `summary.measuredSavingsUSD` (existing fields unchanged), and the new `docs/optimize.md` covers what is scanned, exactly what `--apply` may write, and how to read the health grade.

- **`CODEBURN_CACHE_SCOPE=all` forces a full session-cache read.** A ranged query reads only the month shards that can contribute a turn to it, which is a real behaviour change on a warm cache; this is the escape hatch for the case where a number looks wrong and you want to know whether the scoped read is why. Set it and every load ignores its scope and reads every shard, one-shot runs and the resident `codeburn serve` alike. It is a read policy, not an input to any cache fingerprint: setting or unsetting it re-parses nothing and invalidates nothing.

- **The interactive dashboard opens on Today, and falls back to 7 days when today is empty.** Only the CLI TUI ever defaulted to 7 days; the desktop app and the web dashboard already opened on Today and needed the fallback half alone. The TUI takes the auto path only when `-p` came from the default rather than from you, with no `--day` and no `--from`/`--to`, and only on a TTY - so piped runs, `--format json`/`csv`/`markdown`, `report`, `sessions` and `models` stay on week, byte for byte. The probe costs nothing: it is the today slice of the parse the dashboard already runs, and it counts sessions rather than projects, because a project can survive the slice on a subagent anchor with no sessions behind it. The period strip shows what actually opened, keys 1-6 and every explicit selection win over the fallback, and the app's persisted `defaultPeriod` preference always wins. On a cold cache an empty today costs one extra repaint - the first paint's file floor is Today's, so the 7-day view is re-painted once on the wider floor from the cache pass one just wrote, about 2.3s on a 16.7k-file corpus and only when the cache is empty and the day unused. (#1113)

### Added (OrcaRouter)
- **OrcaRouter sessions now price and label like the model they route to.** OrcaRouter is a gateway that exposes route ids (`orcarouter/auto`, `orcarouter/fusion`, …) plus plain upstream ids (`deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`), and reports the upstream id that actually ran in the completion response's `model` field. The `orcarouter/` prefix is now a routing wrapper like `cmd/` / `antigravity/`, so a routed spelling prices at its upstream LiteLLM row instead of $0; `orcarouter/auto` stays unpriced (the smart route lands on a Qwen/Llama flash model - a Sonnet alias would overprice it) and the fusion routes alias to their current `openai/gpt-oss-120b` target (live completion `model` field, 2026-08); and an unknown vendor nested inside the route still fails closed. Daily cache v29 so warm days re-derive the new prices.

### Added (Windows)
- **`codeburn menubar` installs and launches the tray app on Windows.** The same command that installs the macOS menubar now does the Windows one, through the same pinned-release path: it resolves `windows-v<cliVersion>`, falls back to a scan of the newest `windows-v*` release carrying both assets when that tag has none, downloads the `.msi` with the same retry and backoff, and verifies its sha256 before anything executes it - a mismatch aborts without ever handing the file to the installer. It then runs `msiexec` out of `%SystemRoot%\System32` (never a bare name, so nothing dropped next to the CLI can impersonate it) with `/i <msi> /passive /norestart`, treats exit 3010 as installed-pending-restart and 1602 as a cancelled install rather than failures, and launches the exe named by the product's Uninstall registry key. An already-installed matching version skips the download and just launches; `--force` reinstalls.
- **A menubar app for Windows.** `windows/` is a Tauri 2 tray app - Rust binary, React popover - that puts today's spend in the notification area and mirrors the macOS menubar screen for screen: agent tabs, period switcher, Trend, Forecast, Pulse, Stats and Plan insights, activity and model breakdowns, optimize findings, CSV/JSON export, launch at login, currency, and theme. Windows has no menubar title, so the number lives in a second tray icon rendered from the system font at the panel's native icon size (Settings can turn it off; the tooltip always carries it). It reads everything through the CLI like the macOS and GNOME clients do, and gates on **codeburn 0.9.9 or newer** - the first release accepting `status --format menubar-json --no-optimize` - showing a setup screen with the install command until it finds one. Refresh follows popover visibility the way the macOS app does: 60 s with optimize findings while open, 2 minutes for today's total while closed, and immediately on open when what you are looking at has gone stale. The Claude quota view never spends Claude's single-use refresh token; on a 401 it re-reads Claude Code's own credential file for a token it has already rotated, matching the macOS client. Ships as an unsigned `.msi` from the `windows-v*` tag, which `codeburn menubar` now installs for you. The same crate still builds and runs a tray on Linux, but that stays experimental and unreleased - `gnome/` is the supported Linux surface.

### Added (CLI)
- **Copilot input/cache tokens are read per request from `~/.copilot/session-store.db`.** Previously, codeburn relied on `session.shutdown` rollups from the Copilot CLI and GitHub Copilot desktop app. Those rollups are written only after a clean shutdown, stamp all usage on the shutdown day, and reset their counters at in-session compaction - so a crash could lose an entire session's input/cache usage, and even cleanly-closed long sessions were silently truncated. On one machine with long history, reading the per-request rows recovered about 35% of actual Copilot spend. Covered sessions now use per-request tokens with their real timestamps, counted exactly once against existing rollups and never added as extra calls or turns. Pre-store CLI sessions continue using the unchanged rollup path, and a locked or unreadable store defers only its own re-read instead of prematurely sealing daily history. Copilot reasoning tokens are also no longer double-billed: they are a subset of output already priced through the per-turn calls. This triggers a one-time re-parse, with the daily cache bumped to v26 to re-derive finalized days. Because that reconciliation keeps changing while a session is live, `codeburn sync push` holds a Copilot session back until it has been quiet for 24 hours and then sends it once, final - the sent-ledger is append-once, so a value sent mid-reconciliation could never be corrected at the receiver (#988). Sync also pins each Copilot session to whichever of the two shapes it was first synced in - the `session.shutdown` rollup, or per-request rows plus a residual - because a usage span cannot be retracted and sending the same tokens in the other shape would double them at the receiver permanently. That holds in both directions: a session synced before this release keeps its rollup and never sends rows, and a session synced as rows never sends the rollup that starts serving again once the 90-day age-out prunes them. `--dry-run` reports the frozen count, and `codeburn sync reset --confirm` re-pushes everything under the new breakdown for anyone who can clear the receiver too. (#946)
- **DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) is now a supported provider.** Reads DeepSeek's open-source agent harness from `~/.dsh/sessions` (`DSH_HOME` relocates the root), both the default zstd logs and the uncompressed `session.jsonl` variant. A `.zstd` log is a concatenation of independent zstd frames, one per write batch, so it is decoded frame by frame behind a structural frame scan and a torn trailing frame from a crashed writer is ignored rather than failing the file (needs Node 22.15+ for `zlib` zstd; below that dsh is skipped with a notice instead of counted as $0). One call per `(turn, step)`, with the step's final `assistant/message` usage superseding the streamed `assistant/chunk` sample of the same call rather than adding to it, the model taken from the message that served the step, and reasoning tokens billed at the output rate. DSH records tokens but no cost, so calls are priced from the shared tables. The events a forked session replays from its parent are skipped, since codeburn already counts the parent's own log. The session format is pinned at version 0 upstream with no compatibility implied, so a log stamped with any other version is skipped with a notice instead of read under today's assumptions.

### Added (Desktop & Menubar)
- **Live quota for Gemini, Copilot and Antigravity in the desktop app.** The app's quota module knew claude and codex only; it now carries three more providers, all read from local credentials the tools already wrote - no cookies, no logins, no credential writes anywhere. Gemini goes through Code Assist (`loadCodeAssist` / `retrieveUserQuota`) using the Gemini CLI's own on-disk OAuth material, refreshing a token only when the CLI's documented env overrides are set and keeping the refreshed token in memory; a retired consumer tier degrades to a terminal failure carrying migration guidance rather than a wrong number. Copilot reads the editor-plugin token from `~/.config/github-copilot/hosts.json` → `apps.json` and calls `copilot_internal/user`, re-reading once on a 401 - an internal API that may drift, so every failure degrades to an honest connection state. Antigravity probes the local language server over loopback only (`RetrieveUserQuotaSummary`, falling back to `GetUserStatus`), discovering it through `ps`/`lsof` with regex-validated pids and relaxing TLS strictly for 127.0.0.1 self-signed certificates. Settings gains a per-provider toggle, defaulting on for detected providers; a disabled provider's fetcher never runs, so it reads no credential and makes no request. Provider display names come from a map rather than hardcoded pairs, sign-in guidance is honest per provider, and error sanitization now redacts Google `ya29.` and GitHub `gh*_` token shapes. Kimi live quota already exists in the macOS menubar and was audited rather than duplicated. (#1114)
- **The macOS menubar reaches quota parity with the desktop app, and gets a System Settings-style Settings window.** The three providers above are ported into the menubar read-only from the app's Electron services, on the same load-state machine Kimi, Claude and Codex already use: Gemini through Code Assist and `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` (in-memory refresh only, handling Google's CLI-OAuth tier retirement), Copilot through `copilot_internal/user` and the editor plugin token in `~/.config/github-copilot` (preferring the github.com host), and Antigravity through `ps`+`lsof` discovery and Connect-RPC probes over loopback HTTPS with the self-signed-certificate trust override scoped strictly to 127.0.0.1. Settings is rebuilt as a System Settings-style window: a fixed 260pt sidebar with native search, SF Symbol gradient chips, independently sourced provider marks with connected dots and an N-on counter, and a grouped About pane whose Updates row is wired to the existing update checker. The window is resizable and fullscreen-capable, titles itself after the visible pane, and recenters when it would be restored off-screen. Alongside it: an animated flame-gradient wordmark in the popover header at parity with the site, respecting Reduce Motion; the website's binary `0101` flame as the app icon, the full-colour flame in the About hero and a solid silhouette in the About sidebar row; one tagline everywhere; and em-dashes removed from UI copy. `package-app.sh` now ships the SwiftPM resource bundle inside the `.app` - without it `Bundle.module` aborts at the first icon render, which the release workflow would have shipped. (#1133)

### Changed
- **Report, sessions, overview, compare, export, report JSON and menubar `localModelSavings` now use `billableOutputTokens` for displayed output.** Cost already did. Exclusive providers (Grok and the rest) were under-reporting output by exactly their reasoning tokens; optimize added reasoning on top of output for the inclusive set `{claude, codex, copilot}` and double-counted it. Displayed aggregates now bill per call while the provider is known, joined onto an existing `modelBreakdown` key (parser short name first, then the raw id) so a leftover raw-id bucket cannot mint a $0 `Opus 4.8` Unpriced orphan. Daily cache v28 re-derives finalized days so `report` matches the live parse. Thanks @saulcanina. (#1115)
- **The desktop app's cold start paints as soon as the selected period is readable, instead of after the whole history.** The resident `codeburn serve` child now does for its JSON clients what the TUI got in #1107: on a cold cache it answers the first `status --format menubar-json` from the files whose mtime allows them to hold data the requested period can show (the same floor and 48h clock-skew margin), then indexes the rest behind the answer. The payload says so in-band through a new optional `hydration: { complete, indexedFiles, totalFiles }` block, and the desktop app and web dashboard render `indexing history · N/M files · totals below cover what is indexed so far` until it reports `complete: true`. On a 21k-file corpus the app's first payload lands in 7.3s instead of 31.3s, fully indexed at 36.2s. Only the resident serve process ever emits `hydration`, and only it may answer partially - its clients poll, so they converge. Every one-shot output is unchanged and always a full parse: `--format json`/`csv`/`markdown`, `report`, `sessions`, `models`, MCP, the Swift menubar and GNOME clients, and the desktop app's own spawn fallback, none of which have a second poll to converge with. Absence of `hydration` therefore always means complete, which is also what an older CLI's payload means. It is not `stale` (#1100) and never sets it: a first paint is fresh but partial, where a stale payload is complete but old. Nothing is stamped complete until the fill has actually parsed everything, so a process killed mid-fill comes back cold and finishes the job. (#1110)
- **The discovery sweep issues its metadata syscalls concurrently.** Every dated command re-walks and re-stats every provider tree before it can decide what is already cached, and that sweep was strictly serial: one `readdir`, one `stat`, one `state.json` read at a time, per provider, one provider after another. On a 21k-file / 9-provider corpus it owned most of a warm run's wall clock while the machine sat idle waiting on the kernel. Provider discovery now runs across providers at once, and the four walks that dominate it (claude, codex, kimicode, grok) plus the Claude project-dir walk and both fingerprint passes fan out through a shared bounded-concurrency helper. Order is unchanged everywhere - each level is re-concatenated in registry/`readdir` order before anything reconciles against the cache - so what is discovered, in what sequence, is byte-identical to the serial walk. Two smaller cuts ride along: the Claude walk reads directory entries with their types so a plain file no longer costs a wasted `subagents/` probe, and the Codex result cache (a single file that can reach hundreds of MB) now shares one in-flight load between concurrent readers instead of letting each one re-read and re-parse it. Warm `codeburn today` on that corpus: 5.30s to 2.99s; a cold parse 34.7s to 31.1s. (#1104)
- **A kill mid-way through a non-Claude provider phase no longer restarts that whole phase.** `scanProjectDirs` (Claude) has long taken a throttled `saveProgress` callback so a killed cold parse resumes from a warm cache; `parseProviderSources` (every other provider - codex, cursor, gemini, and the rest) did not, and only persisted at the whole-provider boundary. On a large single-provider corpus (a multi-GB codex history is the common case) an app-timeout SIGKILL, crash, or force-quit during that phase discarded everything parsed since the last provider finished, forcing the entire phase to re-parse from zero on the next run. `parseProviderSources` now takes the same callback, invoked once per source right after that source's cache entry lands (mirroring `scanProjectDirs`' placement, outside the per-file try/catch), on the same file-count/wall-clock throttle. A file only ever gets a fingerprint once it has fully parsed, so a mid-file kill can never leave a half-parsed file's entry looking complete on resume.
- **Routed model ids price as the model they wrap, and an unknown vendor prefix no longer prices by blind stripping.** Token-plan and gateway spellings of the same model (`omniroute:`, `cp/`, `cline-pass/`, `cline-free/`, `cmd/`, `antigravity/`, `orcarouter/`) are peeled and the remaining id is priced, so a Cline Pass or OmniRoute session shows a `~` estimate instead of $0. In exchange, `provider/model` is no longer treated as authority on its own: the leading segment is stripped only when it is a namespace the bundled pricing catalog itself uses (`anthropic/`, `openai/`, `google/`, `x-ai/`, `qwen/`, `moonshotai/`, `nousresearch/`, `xiaomi/`, `z-ai/`, and every other vendor prefix in the LiteLLM snapshot), one of the routing wrappers above, or one of the client-side spellings `kimi/`, `mimo/`, `zhipu/`, `litellm_proxy/` and `openai_like/`. Anything else stays unpriced and is reported as unpriced rather than inheriting the price of a same-named cloud row, and local-runner prefixes (`ollama/`, `lmstudio/`, `hosted_vllm/`, `local/`) are excluded on purpose so an unlisted local tag can never invent cloud spend. A user price override for the bare id wins over the catalog row a routed spelling would otherwise hit.
- **SQLite providers now survive read-only database parents.** A read-only SQLite open is not read-only on disk: on a WAL database SQLite must create `<db>-shm` and `<db>-wal` in the database's own directory, so a source on read-only media, under restrictive permissions, or inside a Flatpak/snap confinement failed with `attempt to write a readonly database` (or `unable to open database file` when a `-wal` was present without its `-shm`), and both discovery sites swallowed it - the provider read as "not installed" rather than as an error. That covers cursor, cursor-agent, opencode, goose, warp, kilo-code, zerostack and the copilot agent-traces database. The direct open stays the fast path and is byte-identical when it succeeds. When it fails for want of sidecars: a database with no WAL frames to lose is opened in place with `immutable=1`, which costs nothing and cannot go stale; a database with a non-empty `-wal` is copied with its `-wal` into the CodeBurn cache and read there, so its un-checkpointed rows are never silently dropped. The copy costs one database's worth of disk and is taken once per change - it is keyed by the main-plus-WAL fingerprint, published under a fingerprint-stamped name so a refresh never overwrites a copy another process is reading, and superseded copies are evicted once a day has passed without a read, keeping at most one predecessor. If the cache itself cannot be written, the database is skipped with a notice naming it and the reason rather than in silence. The original provider database is never opened writable or modified.
- **Grok Build now reads the CLI's own completed-turn usage instead of estimating it.** Usage comes from the `turn_completed.usage` records Grok CLI already writes into `updates.jsonl` (`inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `cachedReadTokens`, `cacheCreationTokens`, `reasoningTokens`), deduplicated by `prompt_id` and emitted as one session-level call from the top-level totals. The previous parser reconstructed an estimate from the running `_meta.totalTokens` context counter, so **existing Grok totals will change materially on upgrade** - on one real 568-session corpus cache-read went from 150K to 96.3M tokens, total tokens from 20.0M to 113.9M, and cost from $36.98 to $56.79. Cache read and cache creation are subsets of input and reasoning is a subset of output, so reasoning is clamped to the record's reported output and split back out to match this repo's exclusive-reasoning contract. `modelUsage` only selects a priced attribution id; multi-model rate attribution stays out of scope, so one session is priced at one model's rate. `costUsdTicks` is ignored because its scale is undocumented. Sessions with no usable record - older CLI versions - keep the old context-curve heuristic and stay flagged estimated. **In a session that has at least one `turn_completed` record, turns without one are not counted at all** (their tokens are dropped rather than estimated), and the session is marked estimated instead of claiming full provider coverage. Cached Grok sessions re-parse once. The daily cache re-derives once on first run after upgrade: this is a global re-derivation of every day and every provider, since the daily cache has no per-provider invalidation, but it reads the warm session cache rather than re-parsing transcripts, so it costs seconds (~3s on the corpus above), and the superseded cache file is retained on disk as the baseline for days no source can still re-derive. (#998)
- **Codex rollouts parse across worker threads too, and the workload gate now takes bytes or files.** Codex is the bigger half of a real cold parse - a 4 GB rollout corpus against 1.8 GB of Claude sessions - and it was still decoding one file at a time. A whole-file rollout decode now runs on the same pool, against an empty dedup set, and comes back with the calls, the dedup keys it claimed, and the codex-cache entry it would have written; the parent installs all three in the serial loop's order, so `codex-results.json` and every payload come out byte-identical to a serial run. Cross-file state stays where it was: a forked rollout replaying its parent's token_count history collides on the parent's keys and is re-parsed in-process, and no worker ever touches the cache module's per-directory state. Files the Codex cache can serve exactly or resume into from a byte offset never reach a worker - they read a few KB and the resume state belongs to the parent. The workload gate is now pending BYTES alone (200 MB), not file count: 250 pending files holding under a megabyte between them spawned threads that made the run ~5% slower, while a few hundred huge rollouts were being turned away. The count takes `max(pendingFiles / 50, pendingBytes / 200 MB)`, and the per-thread memory budget is derived per parse as `clamp(256 MB, 2 × average pending file + 128 MB, 1 GB)` rather than a flat 256 MB - a 260 MB rollout peaks near 430 MB in its worker and scales linearly with the pool, so the flat figure over-subscribed exactly the workload this adds. The decision is per provider, and at most one pool is alive at a time.
- **A large cold Claude parse now runs across worker threads.** Reading, decoding and line-parsing a session JSONL is per-file work that never touches anything shared, so it moves onto `worker_threads`; each worker ships its parsed turns back as a JSON string and the parent installs them in the exact order the serial loop would. Everything with cross-file state - the streaming-message dedup, canonical project paths, spawn links, PR correlation, progress saves - stays on the main thread, and a file whose message ids were already claimed by an earlier file (or whose worker failed) is simply re-parsed in-process, so the session cache and every payload are identical either way. On a 6 GB corpus a cold `status` drops from 27.5s to 14.8s with peak RSS up 2.27 GB → 2.52 GB. Threads only engage for a genuinely large cold parse: never with under 200 MB behind the pending whole-file re-parses, 2 or fewer cores, or under 4 GB of available memory - so warm and incremental runs are untouched and spawn nothing. Otherwise the count is `min(cores - 1, min(0.25 × available, 2 GB) / 256 MB, pendingFiles / 50)`, where available is `process.availableMemory()` (cgroup-aware in containers) rather than free memory, which on macOS reports free pages and would switch the feature on and off between runs. `CODEBURN_PARSE_WORKERS=0` forces the serial parse and `CODEBURN_PARSE_WORKERS=N` forces N (capped at the core count), both bypassing every gate; `CODEBURN_VERBOSE=1` prints the resolved count and why.
- **A warm launch rewrites only the month that changed, and a ranged query reads only the months it can report on.** Per-provider shards still meant one appended session republished that provider's entire history - 95 MB for Claude on a 6 GB corpus. Each provider's shard is now split again by the UTC month of the cached session's FIRST turn, a bucket that never moves as a session grows, so an append rewrites one month. Every shard records the newest month it holds, which lets `--period today/week` skip the shards that cannot contribute a turn to the range; the skipped months stay on disk untouched across the save, and providers whose cache is the only surviving record (durable) or whose parse fingerprint moved are always read in full. Remaining shards are read concurrently. Existing v8 and v7 caches are re-laid-out losslessly on first load and the old layout removed once the new one is published: nothing re-parses.
- **A warm launch rewrites only the provider that changed.** The session cache was a single blob, so any provider appending a few KB republished the whole thing - 147 MB of stringify + fsync on a 6 GB corpus, ~18% of a warm run. It is now a version-suffixed directory holding one shard per provider plus a small envelope, written per provider and published by a single envelope rename. An existing v7 cache is re-laid-out losslessly on first load and the old file removed once the new layout is on disk: nothing re-parses. One unreadable shard now costs that provider a re-parse instead of discarding every provider's history, and partial saves during a cold parse are triggered every 2000 files rather than every 5 seconds, so a slow cold parse no longer rewrites the growing cache on a wall clock.
- **An appended Codex rollout parses only its tail.** Rollout files are append-only and the active ones run to hundreds of MB, but the Codex result cache keyed on mtime + size alone, so any growth re-read the file from byte 0. Each entry now records a restart point at the last task boundary - byte offset plus the state the single-pass decode carries across it - and a grown file with the same inode resumes there, producing output identical to a full re-parse. An entry without a usable restart point simply re-parses in full once and gains one.
- **A date-ranged report classifies only the turns it keeps.** Every cached turn went through the turn classifier - category, retries, edit detection, and a full reconstruction of its API calls - before the date slice discarded most of them, so a week view paid to classify all of history to keep a few percent of it. The keep/drop decision is now taken on the raw cached turn and only the survivors are classified, still from their complete call list, with the branch and pull-request carries still walking the full ordered turn list. Output is byte-identical.
- **One rule for every cache file.** `CODEBURN_CACHE_DIR` when set, otherwise `~/.cache/codeburn`. `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is no longer consulted; the sync ledger, the only file that ever honored it, is merged into the canonical location on first read and the legacy copy is retired, so nothing is re-uploaded after the move. (#972)

- **A cold interactive launch paints the dated view first and indexes the rest behind it.** An empty cache parsed all ~21k files before painting a dashboard that shows 7 days. On a cold interactive TTY launch with a dated default view, the first paint now parses only the files that can hold in-range data - `fp.mtimeMs >= rangeStart - 48h`, the clock-skew margin - which is safe because a session log's last event is never later than its mtime, so an older file provably cannot move the dated view; a file that already has a cache entry is never deferred, and network sources always load. The deferred files are parsed by the existing background reload without blocking keys, writing the per-file cache exactly as a full cold parse would and refreshing the panels when it lands, with an `indexing history · N/M files · totals below cover what is indexed so far` banner until it converges. Nothing is marked seen without being parsed: a first paint that deferred anything cannot stamp the cache complete, so a run killed mid-fill re-enters cold and converges, and the floored parse's memo key carries a `:paint<floor>` suffix so it can never be served to an unfloored request. The path is gated on `isTTY` with no `--day` and no `--from`/`--to`, so one-shot JSON/CSV/markdown, `report`/`sessions`/`models` and every serve, menubar and app payload never enter it and never return partial data. On a real 21k-file corpus with an empty cache, time to first paint drops from 36.3s to 9.9s, and full indexing finishes at 47.5s instead of 36.1s - about eleven extra background seconds, paid while you are already looking at data. Two deliberate limits: a period switch during the fill queues behind it rather than slicing partially, and the plan-usage bar can read low until the fill lands, which the banner covers. (#1109)
- **The dashboard parses once per launch instead of up to three times.** Rendering the dashboard issued three `parseAllSessions` calls - the scan, the plan usages and the durable overview - whose ranges differed only in their ends, about a second apart, so the exact-key memo never hit and each one paid a full parse. The dashboard now declares its widest range up front, and any request inside it that is a pure narrowing - same start, an end no later, the same month-shard scope - is served by slicing that single parse. `month` goes from 2 parses to 1 and `today` from 3 to 2; the plan window starts on the 1st while the scan starts at midnight, and two different starts cannot be merged under the rule that makes this provably lossless, because a wider parse reads files a narrower one never sees and its dedup seeding can drop an in-range turn the narrower parse keeps. Alongside it the cross-provider PR correlation stops re-filtering the session list per child and the launch list per candidate, using a one-shot agent index and a windowed scan over a sorted array instead; the match sets are identical. On a frozen corpus, warm `today` in the TUI goes 5.12s to 3.81s and `month` 5.46s to 3.41s, with every checked warm and cold output byte-identical. (#1108)

### Changed (Linux packaging)
- **The snap asks for the log directories it reads, not each tool's whole home.** The first Snap Store submission declared a `personal-files` read of every AI tool's root - `$HOME/.claude`, `$HOME/.codex`, `$HOME/.cursor` and the rest - and that interface is recursive, so it granted read of every credential file those roots hold. Each entry now names the subdirectory the provider actually opens (`.claude/projects`, `.codex/sessions`, `.cline/data`, `.vibe/logs/session`, `.dsh/sessions`, `.kiro/sessions`, `.quickwork/{profiles.json,sessions,metrics}`, `.config/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions`, `.config/Open Design/{runs,data/runs,namespaces}`), two are single files (`.forge/.forge.db`, `.zcode/cli/db/db.sqlite`), and the editor entries name only the extension folders holding transcripts instead of the editor's whole configuration. Five providers that were missing entirely and would have shown no data are declared - opencode, crush, goose, kilo, kimi-code - and four roots stay roots only because the file the provider opens sits directly in them (`.config/github-copilot`, `.local/share/{opencode,crush,kilo}`). One credential file is now requested openly rather than implicitly: `.claude/.credentials.json`, read-only, for the live plan gauge. Codex's equivalent would need write access to the Codex CLI's own `auth.json` to rotate the token, so neither it nor a Codex root is declared and the Codex live gauge is disabled under `$SNAP`; Codex usage and cost are unaffected, they come from the session rollouts. Two consequences inside the snap: `.lingtai` is dropped, because its per-agent log directory needs a wildcard the interface has no form for, and `optimize`, `context-budget` and `act` no longer see the user-scope `~/.claude/settings.json`, `agents/`, `skills/` and `commands/` - project-scope copies still work through the `home` plug. Nothing outside the snap changes.

### Fixed (Desktop & Menubar)
- **The menubar stops killing its own cold cache rebuild.** On a large corpus after the 0.9.20 cache-version bump, the menubar never completed a single fetch: every child was killed at exactly 45 seconds, and each kill left the `session-refresh.lock` behind for the next one to wait out. Four things were wrong and all four are fixed. The 45-second cap was a TOTAL-runtime kill, so it is now the same no-output watchdog the desktop app got in #1096 - spawns and the resident `codeburn serve` alike set `CODEBURN_PROGRESS=1`, the window restarts on every byte of stdout or stderr (the CLI heartbeats every 10 seconds while parsing, and now also while WAITING on the refresh lock, which was the silent stretch that mattered), and only a genuinely mute child is killed, with the same 10-minute cold floor until the first payload lands and the same 15-minute absolute ceiling behind it. Kills are SIGTERM first and SIGKILL only after a 5-second grace, and the refresh lock now arms the same signal cleanup the hydration lock has, so a killed holder unlinks its own lock instead of leaving one. A lock that was abandoned anyway is recovered immediately rather than after 90 seconds: a waiter takes over a lock whose recorded holder pid is gone, or whose heartbeat has frozen, and the waiter's own budget is now derived from the stale window so it can never again expire before the gate it is waiting for opens - a live holder, whose heartbeat keeps the mtime fresh and whose pid answers, is never taken from. The resident child's fixed 60-second warm request cap becomes a silence window that each progress frame restarts, and a spent restart budget is a five-minute cooldown rather than leaving the resident dead for the rest of the app run. Serve orphans get three new backstops: the app closes its end of a retired child's stdin (dropping the handle was not enough - the pipe stayed alive inside the Process), reaps every child it started synchronously at quit before the async shutdown can be skipped, and records the child's pid and command line so a serve orphaned by a crash is reaped on the next launch. On the CLI side a serve child's final exit no longer runs through the `process.exit` an in-flight request has monkeypatched, and its post-drain cleanup is bounded like the drain. (#1117)
- **A long panel query is no longer killed for being slow.** The desktop app capped every read at 45 seconds of TOTAL runtime, so on a slow machine `optimize`, `yield`, `models`, `sessions`, `spend`, `audit`, `act report` and `plan` were SIGKILLed mid-parse and the panel painted a red "timed out" that a 60-second poll then reproduced forever. That cap is now a no-output watchdog: the window restarts on every byte the child writes, so only a genuinely silent child times out, with a 15-minute absolute ceiling still catching a livelocked one. Silence now means stopped rather than slow, because the parse itself heartbeats: every read spawn sets `CODEBURN_PROGRESS=1`, and under it a running parse emits a keepalive line every 10 seconds - the stretch that mattered was a cold parse's inter-provider cache save, measured at 31.6 seconds of total silence on a large corpus, which the old scan-progress stream did not cover at all. A served request heartbeats for its whole duration, parse and the aggregation and serialization after it alike; a one-shot spawn heartbeats through the parse, and the roughly 8-second tail that follows it stays well inside the window on its own. Resident `codeburn serve` requests reset their window on each frame of their own response. Alongside it: the cold-cache floor now covers EVERY read while the first hydration is still running, not just the overview, so a section that starts polling the moment the app is ready is not killed waiting behind that parse; a read that times out while the hydration is still going keeps the indexing splash instead of painting an error panel, bounded so that an install which can never hydrate still surfaces a real error once the cold window has elapsed rather than sitting behind the splash forever; and a read killed for timing out, or a resident child replaced by a settings mutation, is sent SIGTERM first and SIGKILL only after a 5-second grace, so the child can unlink its own cache refresh lock rather than leave it for the next parse's stale-pid takeover (quit stays a hard kill, its flush budget being shorter than the grace). A hydration that genuinely needs more than 15 minutes is still ended by the absolute ceiling, but it no longer starts from nothing next time: the partial cache saved along the way means successive polls converge instead of each repeating the whole scan. The app also records the resident child's pid and full command line, and reaps a serve orphaned by a previous crash on the next launch - on Windows too, where there is no `ps` and no stdin-close recourse after a crash - signalling only when that pid still runs that exact command. Separately, `codeburn serve` drains an in-flight request before exiting on stdin close, bounded at 45 seconds so a wedged request cannot turn the child into the orphan the drain prevents.
- **The menubar's copies of your Claude and Codex credentials move out of Application Support and into the login Keychain.** Connecting a provider used to leave the copied OAuth material in `~/Library/Application Support/CodeBurn/*-credentials.v1.json`, written world-readable (0644) because macOS ignores `.completeFileProtection` outside iOS. The copy now lives in a CodeBurn-owned login-Keychain item, and the first read after upgrading migrates the old file: it is reopened with `O_NOFOLLOW`, refused if it is a symlink or not owned by you, repaired to 0600 before a single secret byte is read, written to the Keychain, read back and compared, and only then unlinked - a failed or unverified write leaves the (now 0600) file in place so a retry can still find it, and the next read retries the cleanup. Where both a Keychain item and an old file exist, the one that expires later wins before anything is removed, so an item left behind by a much older build cannot displace a fresher token. Claude's entry no longer stores a refresh token at all - the CLI owns that grant and the menubar never spends it - and any refresh token in a historical blob is dropped on read. Disconnect only reports success once the material is actually gone; if the delete fails it says so and leaves the provider connected so you can retry. Keychain reads are non-interactive and are skipped outright while the login Keychain is locked, so a background quota refresh can never raise an unlock panel. (#1037)
- **First launch no longer asks to control System Events.** The macOS menubar registered its login item by driving System Events over AppleScript, which made macOS put up an Automation consent dialog the first time the app ran. It now registers itself through `SMAppService.mainApp`, an in-process call that needs no Automation grant; there is no AppleScript fallback, so a failure logs and leaves the login item unset rather than bringing the prompt back. The same `codeburn.loginItemRegistered` guard still limits this to the first launch, so a login item you removed by hand stays removed. (#1026)
- **The resident `codeburn serve` child.** The first real panel request is also the cache warm-up, so startup never runs an artificial warm-up query beside a duplicate one-shot child; each served command carries its own read-only option allowlist, and anything outside it falls back to a normal spawn; the child exits when its stdin closes, so it can never outlive the app. Requests whose response exceeds the 16 MiB frame limit still replace the child, but that deliberate kill no longer spends the resident's unexpected-death budget. (#972)

- **The desktop app's Pull requests tab says why it is empty.** A PR row exists only where a transcript actually contains a pull-request URL, and the default period is Today, so a week of work through providers that never write those URLs left the tab blank with copy that named neither the period nor the reason - indistinguishable from a broken extractor. The empty note now names the selected period, and when the All period does hold rows it says how many and points at the period control. Attribution itself is untouched: no link is inferred, no PR is invented, and the default period is unchanged. (#1098)

### Fixed
- **Hermes sessions that keep running after a day is sealed no longer lose later token and cost growth.** A sidecar ledger under the CodeBurn cache records last-seen lifetime totals per `(profile, sessionId)` and emits observation-time deltas (weight 0) so a sealed day stays put while today's growth still lands. An all-zero reset is visible to the cursor after discovery filtering, so a later 40 is `+40` rather than a silent shrink. Explicit `$0` is treated as recorded. Ledger publication failures are retryable and hold the daily watermark. (#916)
- **`codeburn doctor` now probes the five remaining fixed-location providers.** `codebuff`, `devin`, `gemini`, `kiro`, and `mistral-vibe` implement `probeRoots()` through the same resolvers discovery uses, so a silent zero is distinguishable from a missing install. Codebuff reports all three manicode channels unless a factory or `CODEBUFF_DATA_DIR` pins one; Devin reports `transcripts` plus `sessions.db`, not the parent; Gemini reports only `~/.gemini/tmp`; Kiro reports pre-filter candidates (empty CLI/v2 skipped, empty agent/workspace fall back); Mistral Vibe reports the joined sessions dir. Missing defaults still appear. Thanks @therickfactr. (#899)

- **Subscription SKUs are classified from real product ids, and a false-positive built-in can be opted out.** `codex-auto-review` consumes ordinary Codex usage ([openai/codex#32224](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/32224)) and is priced as GPT-5.5 on #1056, so treating it as $0 hid real spend - it left the flat-rate list. Warp's product id is `auto`, not the synthetic `warp`. `kimi-for-coding-highspeed` (the SKU #968 was filed around) is now honestly $0. `big-pickle` was dropped: it appears under OpenCode, not as a cited ClinePass codename. `codeburn model-flat-rate --remove` now opts out of a built-in, so a wrong classifier entry can warn again without waiting for a release. The daily-cache config hash now always includes the flat-rate section (even when empty), so the first run after upgrade re-derives every stored day once from the warm session cache. (#968, #1050)
- **Codex MCP and skill usage is attributed from every shape Codex records a shell command in.** `mcp-cli call <server> <tool>` was only recognized when the command arrived as `function_call` arguments (#656). Codex has two other shapes for the same exec: its custom-tool transport records the shell tool as a `custom_tool_call` whose payload is an `input` program rather than `arguments`, and its item model repeats a finished command as `event_msg`/`item_completed` carrying a `CommandExecution` item with an argv `command`. Both reached the Bash counter and neither reached the matcher, so a CLI-wrapped MCP call stayed absent from the MCP breakdown exactly as before the fix. All three shapes now feed one classification pipeline. The same pipeline learns skills: Codex has no skill tool, so loading one is a shell read of the skill's `SKILL.md`, and those reads landed entirely under Bash with the Skills dimension empty. A read counts as a skill load only when the command segment starts with a file-reading binary (`cat`/`bat`/`sed`/`head`/`tail`/`less`/`more`) and the path it reads ends in `<name>/SKILL.md`; the skill is `<name>`, the same key `pi` derives for a native skill read (#588) and the same vocabulary the Claude parser records from the `Skill` tool. A `grep`/`rg`/`ls` that merely mentions a `SKILL.md` is a search near the file, not a skill load, and stays plain Bash. This is attribution only - no call, token or cost figure moves, and a command carried by both a response item and an item-model item is attributed once. On a 1,397-rollout corpus: Skills went from empty to 7 skills over 35 turns (55 attributions), Bash was unchanged at 42,170, and cost, calls, tokens, sessions, daily, models and projects came back identical. Cached Codex sessions re-parse once (`CODEX_CACHE_VERSION` 13 → 14 and the codex parse version both move; without them the fix is invisible on a warm cache). Thanks @chr-evensen. (#478)
- **`gpt-5.6-codex` and `gpt-5.6-codex-max` now have their own pricing rows.** Neither id is in LiteLLM yet, and both were missing from the bundled snapshot - flagged during #1075 verification on a real corpus (285 sessions, 5,446 calls). `getModelCosts` already resolved both through the `gpt-5.6` prefix fallback, so live pricing was already correct once a session priced fresh; every prior Codex-suffixed id LiteLLM does carry bills identically to its bare-model sibling of the same generation (`gpt-5-codex` == `gpt-5`, `gpt-5.1-codex` == `gpt-5.1-codex-max` == `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.2-codex` == `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.3-codex` == `gpt-5.3`), which is the evidence both new rows mirror rather than inventing a rate. The gap that does not self-heal is the daily cache: it has no per-provider invalidation, so a day finalized while either id had no billable rate keeps that $0 forever. Raising `MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION` (v23 -> v24) forces the one-time re-derivation, a lossless no-op for days already correct. (#1077)
- **Mixed-version installs no longer thrash the Codex / Cursor / Antigravity result caches.** Daily and session caches already own a version-suffixed file so an old desktop binary and a newer CLI cannot clobber each other. The three per-provider result caches still used one unsuffixed filename with an internal version field, so a v10 and a v11 binary rewrote the same `codex-results.json` (and the Cursor / Antigravity siblings) on every run and each re-parsed its whole corpus. They now write `*-results.v<n>.json` the same way the daily cache does. The unsuffixed file is left for older binaries; a matching-version copy is adopted once and never overwritten. (#1082)
- **Codex spend no longer counts reasoning tokens twice, and cache writes are priced only where OpenAI actually charges for them.** OpenAI bills reasoning tokens as *part of* `output_tokens`, not on top of it - on a 1,396-rollout corpus all 134,316 events carrying a total satisfy `input + output == total` - but CodeBurn added `reasoning_output_tokens` to output when pricing a Codex call and again in the models, audit and per-model displays. Every Codex number was therefore too high: on that corpus **cost by $166.03 (3.5%)** and **displayed Output tokens by 34.6%** ($4,713.12 -> $4,547.09; 22.6M -> 16.8M output tokens). The raw `reasoningTokens` figure is unchanged and still reported on its own; only the double-count is gone. Both places that price a Codex call - the parser and the cache-rehydration re-price - now go through one shared `billableOutputTokens` helper, so a cold run and a warm run can never disagree. Separately, Codex's `cache_write_input_tokens` (new in codex PR #33454) was never read and cache-creation tokens were hardcoded to 0; they are now carved out of the uncached-input bucket and clamped so they can never exceed it. That carve-out happens **only on models whose pricing source publishes a real cache-write rate** - gpt-5.6 and its terra/sol/luna variants charge 1.25x input for a cache write, everything before it charges nothing extra - because CodeBurn fabricates a 1.25x rate when a source omits one, and charging that would have invented a surcharge on gpt-5.5, gpt-5.4, gpt-5.3-codex and gpt-5. On models without an explicit rate the tokens stay in the plain input bucket and the price is unchanged to the cent. The field is new enough that today's impact is $0 on that corpus. Codex sessions re-parse once and the daily cache re-derives once off the warm session cache (a global re-derivation of every day and every provider, since it has no per-provider invalidation); no other provider's numbers move. Days whose Codex transcripts have since aged out are held by the same never-lose guard #1040 relies on: a re-derivation that finds fewer calls than the settled baseline keeps the older, pre-fix (double-counted) total rather than truncating it, so those days do not pick up the repricing until their sources are re-derived with equal or greater evidence. Long-context pricing tiers from the same report are tracked separately in #1076 and the missing `gpt-5.6-codex` snapshot rows in #1077. Thanks @chr-evensen. (#1075)
- **Codex Tok/s no longer counts reasoning tokens twice or credits harness startup as model time.** Two distortions in the same metric, found and fixed together because they share the same cache-invalidation and test surface. (1) #1075 fixed the reasoning-token double-count for cost, but `activeGeneratedTokens`/`taskGeneratedTokens` in the Codex parser and `generatedTokens` in the `codex-tps` live-throughput reader still summed `outputTokens + reasoningTokens`; both now go through the same `billableOutputTokens('codex', …)` helper #1075 introduced, so the numerator can never drift from the billed one. (2) Codex fires `task_started` before it assembles the request, so the gap up to the first request-context event (`turn_context`, `world_state`, `event_msg/user_message`, or a `response_item/message`) was pure CLI/harness startup counted as active model time - the active window now starts at that first event instead, which matters most for one-shot `codex exec` sessions that pay the gap on every task. The duplicated tool-interval clip/merge/cap logic in `providers/codex.ts` and `codex-throughput.ts` is now one function (`mergeToolIntervals`, exported from `codex-throughput.ts`), which also closes a live trap where `task_complete`'s duration only parsed a plain number and silently dropped the `{secs,nanos}`/string forms `mcp_tool_call_end` already tolerated. (A third suspected distortion - fork-replay dedup dropping a token_count event's tokens from the numerator without shrinking the window to match - was investigated and retracted: the earlier `prevCumulativeTotal` guard already discards a repeated running total before dedup is ever reached, so a real Codex writer never produces a partial drop; the dedup site now carries a comment recording this so the trip isn't repeated.) Display only, no cost or token-count impact - verified byte-identical on the same real corpus. Combined effect on a real Codex corpus (original bug -> all fixes): GPT-5.5 37.8 -> 28.2 tok/s (-25.5%), Codex Auto Review 23.3 -> 20.0 (-14.2%), GPT-5.6 Sol 43.2 -> 33.9 (-21.4%), GPT-5.6 Luna 53.5 -> 49.0 (-8.5%), GPT-5.4 68.0 -> 43.6 (-35.9%), GPT-5.4 Mini 54.9 -> 55.6 (**+1.1%**, the harness-startup correction outweighing the reasoning-count correction for this model on this corpus). `activeGeneratedTokens`/`activeDurationMs`/`toolWaitMs` are stored verbatim in both the Codex result cache and the session cache rather than re-derived on read, so none of this self-heals: Codex sessions re-parse once (one cache-version bump covers both fixes, since they touch the same fields). The dashboard's per-model column stays labelled `Tok/s` - a wider label had zero room at the standard three-column layout, verified by breaking a real width-budget test - but the legend beneath it now reads "Effective Tok/s: generated tokens ÷ time the agent spent waiting on the model, tool execution excluded. Includes prefill, request assembly and reasoning. Not comparable to vendor decode-speed figures." (#1079, #1088)
- **Codex calls attributed from session metadata no longer carry a stale model.** The Buffer fast path scanned `session_meta` for the first `"model"` string anywhere in the payload, so a nested `base_instructions.provenance.model` was read as if it were `payload.model` - and since the model is last-writer-wins state, that wrong value was credited to every call before the rollout's first `turn_context` and to every call after any mid-file `session_meta` (29 of 1380 rollouts on one real corpus carry a late `session_meta`, and 57 record usage before any `turn_context`). Direct payload fields are now read depth-aware, which is what the non-fast `JSON.parse` path always did. Codex sessions re-parse once (~9s on a 4 GB rollout corpus) and the daily cache re-derives once off the warm session cache, a global re-derivation of every day and every provider since it has no per-provider invalidation; it moves per-model attribution, and clears any rollup an earlier parse change had left stale. Days whose transcripts have partly aged out are held by the never-lose guard: on a real 110-day cache no day lost value and none disappeared - 100 days came back identical and 9 grok days rose by $19.80 in total. Thanks @timdp. (#1040)
- **Codex `session_meta` cwd / session id / originator follow the same depth-1 window as `model`.** #1040 fixed nested `provenance.model`; the compact Buffer path still took the first `cwd`, `session_id`, `originator`, `name`, `forked_from_id` or `model_provider` anywhere in the payload, so a `dynamic_tools[].name` (or any same-named nested key) could steal the top-level field. Those strings now use the existing payload-depth-1 scan. Function-call `name` on other event types is unchanged. Codex sessions re-parse once. (#1045)
- **Plan rows for sticker-price presets read as a budget instead of live provider quota.** There is no Grok quota endpoint, so a SuperGrok row was parsed API-equivalent spend divided by the plan's sticker price on a monthly reset - but the TUI labelled that math "plan" and "reset", which next to a client showing xAI's real weekly window read as CodeBurn being wrong. The bars and the arithmetic are unchanged; the words are not. Both the dashboard and the desktop app now say the number is an API-equivalent monthly budget and not a live provider window, in the same wording on both surfaces, and for every preset rather than as a SuperGrok special case. The window is anniversary-based (`plan.resetDay`, settable with `codeburn plan set --reset-day`), so it is called a budget reset rather than a calendar one. The row was also shortened to fit 80 columns: at that width the percentage and the projected month were being truncated away, including on custom plans, whose label carries the provider.
- **MiMo sessions price from the LiteLLM Xiaomi rows, and MiMo v2 Flash no longer crashes the display path.** Hermes / Xiaomi token-plan sessions store the bare id (`mimo-v2.5-pro`, `mimo-v2.5`) while LiteLLM namespaces its row (`xiaomi/…`), so those models reported $0. They now alias to the existing snapshot rows - no invented rate, and `kimi-k3` still has none - which means a session Hermes left costless is priced from the shared tables and carries the estimated marker, exactly as `mimo-v2-flash` already did. The same change fixes a **pre-existing** crash that this alias did not introduce: the shipped `mimo-v2-flash -> xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash` alias already cycled through display-name resolution - strip the namespace, alias it back, take the leaf, repeat - so `getShortModelName` blew the stack on any real MiMo v2 Flash session and took every surface that names a model down with it, the `models` table included. Display-name resolution is now cycle-safe, and the `mimo-v2-flash` and `mimo-v2.5` rows are named rather than shown as raw slugs.
- **A date-ranged run no longer republishes the month shards it never read.** A scoped load leaves an out-of-range month on disk, so the files it holds have no visible cache entry and the reconcile re-parses them - re-deriving the entry the shard already stores. That re-parse marked the unloaded month dirty, and the save merged and republished it under a fresh nonce name on every single run, byte-identical content and all, so a repeated `codeburn status --format json` churned old months (on a real corpus: claude/2026-03, cursor/2026-02 and warp/2026-03 renamed every run) and left the retired shards for the sweeper. A merge into an unloaded month that neither adds, changes nor removes an entry now keeps the published shard, so unchanged months keep their names and their bytes. (#1032)
- **`models` and `audit` no longer show two identical `Grok 4.5` rows.** `grok-4.5-build` - the Grok Build harness's variant id - fell into the `grok-4.5` display entry by prefix, and since rows bucket by model id, not display name, the two came out as visually identical rows with different numbers. The variant now shows as `Grok 4.5 (build)`. Display only: no id is rewritten and no cost moves. (#1029)
- **An upgrade no longer loses history for days whose transcripts have only PARTLY aged out.** The never-lose contract carried a cached (day, provider) slice forward only when the re-derivation found NOTHING for it, but transcripts expire per FILE rather than per day: on a day whose sources are mostly gone, a handful of turns from surviving later files still bucket onto it, so the fresh slice came back non-empty but truncated and REPLACED the full cached one. On a real cache upgrading from the last shipped daily-cache version, 2026-07-16 fell from $1,685.17 / 12,530 calls to $385.44 / 560 calls, and 13 days lost $2,765.75, 19,209 calls and 520 sessions in total. A fresh slice now replaces a settled baseline slice only when it carries at least as many CALLS - the same or more evidence; fewer calls means the source set demonstrably lost data, and the baseline is kept whole. The comparison is on calls alone: cost and tokens are re-priced accounting on the same evidence, which is exactly what a legitimate re-derivation changes (the Grok accounting fix keeps its per-day calls and is unaffected), and session counts drift down by a few on days whose sources are entirely intact. Days inside a 7-day settle window stay authoritative - their session files are still on disk, so a shrink there is a real change rather than expiry. The trade-off is deliberate and matches the direction this cache has always chosen: a future fix that legitimately REDUCES calls on a settled day keeps the older, higher value until that day is re-derived at an equal or greater call count. The timezone-change re-derive gets the exact form of the same rule - what the fresh parse can no longer explain under the old bucketing is added on top of the fresh slice instead of being dropped - and the cross-file adoption union is unchanged, where the newer schema still wins per (day, provider).
- **The session chart legend now leads with a visible session disambiguator and title instead of the project path.** Every series in a monorepo shared the same project prefix, so the only thing separating them was a truncated hex fragment - and per-application cost attribution is the main reason to open that chart. `SessionSummary.title` is already parsed and already rendered in the Context tab; the legend now puts the short session id first, prefers the title, and falls back to the previous project-based label when a session never produced one. Titles come from transcripts, so they are stripped of ANSI and control characters and capped before they reach either the legend or the tooltip. (#997)
- **Context-bloat detection now counts reasoning tokens as generated output.** `detectContextBloat` divided context by `totalOutputTokens` alone, but reasoning is stored beside output rather than inside it, so for every reasoning-bearing provider the detector saw a fraction of the tokens actually generated and invented findings - a session whose real ratio was 20:1, under the 25:1 threshold, was reported as 133:1 and "high impact". It now uses the same `output + reasoning` sum the reports use, which corrects grok, codex, kiro, hermes, qwen and cursor-agent alike.
- **The unpriced-models warning in the dashboard is now readable at every terminal width.** It lived in a fixed-width panel with an inline model list and a fix command, so it clipped mid-name at 80 columns and clipped *earlier* at 200, where the three-column layout narrows each panel - neither the affected models nor a runnable command survived. The panel line is now a pointer, `! N unpriced: codeburn models --unpriced` (shortened to `! N: codeburn models --unpriced` below 45 columns of panel), and the model list moves to that command's plain output, which is full width, copyable, and lists every model rather than the first two. The command's hint no longer reads as an unconditional instruction to alias: a subscription or flat-rate model is correctly $0, and mapping it onto another model's per-token rate would invent spend that was never billed. Provider-supplied model IDs are now stripped of terminal control characters in every human-readable report rather than only on the unpriced path, and `--unpriced` shows raw IDs instead of friendly names because `model-alias` keys on the raw ID. (#969)
- **`codeburn models --unpriced --top N` returned nothing for a `--top N` smaller than the number of priced models.** `--top` is applied inside `aggregateModels`, before the unpriced filter, on rows sorted cost-first - and unpriced rows are $0 on both, so they sorted last and the slice removed exactly the rows the flag exists to show. A user with unpriced models was told they had none. The slice now runs after the filter - and after ranking, because unpriced rows tie at $0 on both keys, so slicing them in aggregate order kept whichever models happened to appear earliest in the transcript rather than the largest. The order now matches the one the unpriced-models warning shows. (#969)
- **Old durable sources remain visible while they still exist.** The 90-day session-cache age-out now applies only after a durable source disappears from discovery, so an unchanged older Copilot source keeps reporting usage and reuses its persisted fingerprint instead of being reparsed and immediately discarded. (#987) On long-lived machines this makes previously dropped history reappear, so lifetime totals can jump once after upgrading.
- **`optimize` no longer treats subagent transcripts as your sessions.** Claude Code writes each subagent's transcript to its own `subagents/agent-*.jsonl` file with `isSidechain: true` on every entry, and optimize counted each one as a user-started session. That inflated the session count in the header and fed the session-level detectors a population that fails their tests by construction: a sidechain is handed a large context and returns a short answer (context-heavy), and it never commits or opens a PR because its parent does (low-worth). Excluded from sidechains now: the header session count, the `low-worth-sessions`, `context-bloat`, `cost-outliers` and `capability-reliability` detectors, the coaching notes, the file-churn table, the median time-to-first-edit, the worst one-shot category, and the model-default recommendation - plus `duplicate-reads`, because a subagent starts on a fresh context and re-reading what its parent read is a necessary read, not a repeat. Everything else keeps the full population: `build-folder-reads` and `read-edit-ratio` still count calls made inside a sidechain, since reading `node_modules` or editing without reading is the same waste whoever does it and the `CLAUDE.md` rule they suggest binds subagents too, and so do the MCP, cache-bloat, ghost-command and configuration-overhead findings. Classification is sticky across the whole file, so calls that appear before the first marked entry are reclassified too, and `isSidechain` now survives the compact parser's 32 KB large-line path and warm-cache range rebuilds. Nothing is deleted from spend: sidechain tokens, calls and cost stay in every total and in `status`, and the optimize result cache keys on sidechain identity so a run cannot be served a pre-fix result. Absent markers still read as user-started, so no cache re-parse is needed. (#974)
- **`optimize` no longer offers `claude mcp remove` for claude.ai connectors, and its MCP schema-cost estimate is per session.** A `claude_ai_*` namespace that no readable local MCP config claims is a claude.ai connector, managed through `/mcp` or claude.ai Settings rather than as a local MCP server (a local server that carries the prefix keeps its removal command and gains a same-name connector note); low-coverage findings now render them as a manual follow-up and build `--apply` plans only for exact local server names found in readable MCP config, so mixed findings remove only the local subset and the "apply-able" subtotal counts only that subset. The same change replaces the old global schema-cost cap with per-session, per-server proportional attribution - a more accurate model that lowers `mcp-low-coverage` estimates for everyone, connectors or not (on a large corpus roughly by half). (#975, #991)
- **Bash command splitting was quadratic on long whitespace-heavy commands.** The separator regex retried its leading `\s*` from every offset; matching the separator alone and widening over whitespace by hand makes cold parse ~24% and warm ~40% faster on large corpora, output unchanged.
- **Cold parse no longer retains full message bodies through cached previews.** `flatSlice` skipped its Buffer round-trip for strings already within the bound, but provider adapters pre-truncate user-message previews with `.slice(0, 500)` before the cache-site call - those pre-sliced views are still V8 SlicedStrings pinning their large parent, so the retention that OOM'd cold parses of large histories survived. The round-trip now always runs.
- **Kiro sessions carry the real `projectPath`** (CLI meta.cwd, v2 `workspacePaths[0]`, workspace sessions' `workspaceDirectory`), so git-repo attribution can resolve them; previously they were attribution-blind. Bumps the kiro parse version, so the first run after upgrade re-parses kiro history once, and kiro sessions in linked git worktrees now group under the main repo.
- **A ranged parse can no longer write a day outside the range it was asked for.** A turn that straddles local midnight keeps its original anchor through range slicing, so the day aggregator could emit a residue day just outside the parsed window - cost, calls and tokens all zero, category counts only - and both ranged call sites, the re-derive and the gap fill, wrote it into durable history. The merge guards below defuse the overwrite, but the residue should never reach the cache at all, so both ranged sites now filter to the days actually in range. The aggregator and the slicer are untouched, so whole-corpus callers are unaffected. (#1131)
- **The daily cache's gap-fill path can no longer overwrite a good day with a degraded parse, and a day left holding only midnight residue heals itself.** `ensureCacheHydrated`'s gap fill wrote days into durable history through a blind overwrite with no completeness gate, so a parse degraded by the refresh lock - the menubar refreshing concurrently is the ordinary way this happens - could permanently replace a settled day with its undercount; the re-derive path had completeness and partial-survival guards, the gap path had neither. A gap merge is now completeness-gated: a complete parse wins per (date, provider) through the same guarded merge the re-derive uses, while a partial parse can only fill gaps and never shrinks the baseline, and a `pendingRederive` is no longer silently dropped. A day holding only a straddling turn's category counts, with cost, calls and tokens at zero, now pulls the watermark back so the next launch re-derives it - bounded to the settle window and never the oldest cached day. `codeburn doctor` reports cache health read-only, listing residue-only dates and failed or empty session-cache entries, so the next report of this shape is one command rather than archaeology. There is no cache-version bump: every affected cache heals on its next launch. (#1129)
- **`codeburn sync` no longer puts a filesystem path or a raw output count on the wire.** Every synced span carried `ai.project` as the slugified absolute path (`-Users-you-Projects-thing`), contradicting both `docs/sync/README.md` ("paths stay local") and the compatibility contract's "safe project basename"; the wire name is now the leaf directory name, derived at the single choke point after the parse, and `codeburn yield`'s local output is untouched. Two directories with the same leaf collapse to one wire identity - that is what the contract's project identity means - and `git.repo` disambiguates them. Separately, `ai.output_tokens` was the raw output field, so exclusive-reasoning providers were under-reported on the wire by exactly their reasoning volume (measured on one corpus: an opencode session short by 37,848 tokens, its summed reasoning); it now goes through the same `billableOutputTokens` helper the display layer took, leaving the inclusive providers byte-identical. Cost is unaffected, being priced before export. Neither field is part of a span id, so nothing is re-sent and nothing duplicates at the receiver: usage span ids and commit attribution keys carry no project, and session attribution re-emits once per session under an upsert keyed on (org, trace). (#1126)
- **Outbound project metadata now requires proven provenance instead of failing open.** The basename mapper above still accepted whatever the cache held, so a Claude path slug, a generated session title, a home root, a relative path, a provider's own storage directory, a credential-shaped basename or a provider-owned container path could all become an outbound project label. The privacy decision moves to the OTLP boundary and demands explicit provenance: a usage span's `ai.project` comes only from a provider-recorded absolute cwd, attribution resolves repositories only from that same trusted cwd and derives its `ai.project` from the normalized `git.repo`, and a legacy cached cwd with no provenance fails closed. A relative cwd can never be resolved against the directory that happens to be running `sync`; Hermes prompt-derived paths, including the legacy Windows `Current working directory:` messages, stay local grouping labels and never become outbound provenance - a deliberate privacy correction; Goose propagates its own `sessions.working_dir` field while `/sessions/<container>` paths are rejected centrally; and provider, model, tool and span-name identifiers are sanitized at serialization, with real routed identifiers still supported. `ai.project` remains optional, so a receiver must accept an unattributed span; where a trace carries both labels and they differ, the attribution repository basename is authoritative and the provisional usage basename must not be counted as a second project. (#1128)
- **Attribution spans no longer carry the session id in cleartext.** `codeburn sync push --attribution` copied `ai.session_id` onto session and commit spans even though `deriveTraceId(sessionId)` already keys both usage and attribution spans, and usage spans never carried the field; it is dropped from both, and the docs now match the wire. This is hygiene rather than a leak - the id existed on the wire only as hash input before attribution shipped - but a receiver that keyed session rows on `ai.session_id` must key on `traceId`, the same id usage spans already carry. The join to usage is unchanged, and the local sent-ledger keys still use the session id. (#1073)
- **`codeburn doctor` names Buzz as a launcher instead of showing it as a second Codex tree.** Buzz sits on top of Codex, so a Buzz usage parser or a walk of `~/.buzz/.codex` as a second Codex home would count the same billed seat twice - but doctor only knew providers, so a nest holding no usage store of its own read as "nothing found". Buzz is now listed as a launcher billed through Codex, with no session count, as is Grok Bot when `~/.grok` is the real store, and Codex discovery returns nothing for a home nested under `~/.buzz` while a distinct primary Codex home exists. A sole Codex home that does live under `.buzz` is still counted. Spend stays on the Codex row; no Buzz parser and no rates were added. (#1099)
- **`codeburn models` resolves raw ids the way `report` does, and stops splitting one SKU across two rows.** The report bucketed by raw id after asking each provider for a label, so a provider whose local table missed fell back to the raw id (`gpt-5.6-sol`, `accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2p6`) - and a later merge keyed on the display string, which summed genuinely distinct SKUs whose labels happen to collide into a single row. Provider-first resolution stays and local labels still win (the Cursor estimated suffix, provider overrides); a provider that merely echoes the raw id now falls through to the global short-name table, which `cursor-agent` and `vercel-gateway` also consult after their own transform. Rows merge on provider plus alias-resolved canonical id, so a path-form id merges with its bare slug and display names go back to being cosmetic: two SKUs that only share a label stay two rows. The first-seen raw id is kept, so `models --format json` is not rewritten to a lexically smallest spelling, and a Codex credit row mixing rated and unrated buckets partial-sums the rated ones and reports `creditsIncomplete` rather than a confident total. `audit` still buckets by raw id, because it recomputes rates per id. (#1053)
- **A resumed Copilot CLI session's stampless shutdown legs no longer collapse onto one day.** Each leg of a resumed session appends its own `session.shutdown` rollup, and a journal whose legs carry `sessionStartTime` but no per-leg timestamp fell back to that start time - identical across every leg - so all of them billed onto one date and, with that stamp in the dedup key, onto one row. The timestamp fallback is now the event's own stamp, then the last event seen, and only then the session start, so a stampless leg lands on its last stamped event; the occurrence keys (`copilot:<sid>:shutdown:<model>:<n>`) are unchanged, so nothing already synced is re-sent under a new name. (#1054)
- **`codeburn optimize --provider <x>` no longer tells you to ask Claude.** Provider filtering already skipped the Claude-only detectors, but the cross-provider ones - `retry-heavy-capabilities`, `low-worth-sessions`, `context-heavy-sessions`, `cost-outliers`, `mcp-project-scope` - baked "Ask Claude" and `CLAUDE.md` into their fix labels, and the CLI and TUI destination headers said Claude whatever the run was scoped to, with the JSON report carrying the same copy through. One remediation table now drives all of them: an unscoped run, `--provider all` and `--provider claude` keep the shipped Claude and `CLAUDE.md` copy; `codex` says Codex and `AGENTS.md`, the only other instruction file CodeBurn already names; every other provider gets its display name and a generic "project instructions" rather than an invented filename. Apply plans still write `CLAUDE.md` only for Claude-only findings, and the paste-destination values are unchanged. (#1049)
- **Resizing the terminal or zooming its font produces one settled reflow instead of a burst of intermediate widths.** CodeBurn re-rendered on every `resize` event from `process.stdout` with the live `columns`/`rows`, and debouncing that listener alone cannot stop Ink, which runs its own resize handler. During a burst the dashboard now sees a frozen stdout facade and a private resize emitter, and on settle it re-renders once and lets Ink see a single resize - no write interceptor, which was the earlier shape's trap: swallowing frames still advanced Ink's last-output state, so a settle producing the same string wrote nothing and lost a mid-burst update forever. One transient old-width frame during the burst is accepted. Static and non-interactive output and the periodic refresh are unchanged. (#1038)

## 0.9.20 - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **Desktop panel fetches drop from seconds to milliseconds.** The app, the web dashboard and the macOS menubar now hold one resident `codeburn serve` process instead of spawning a fresh CLI per panel: the parsed session cache stays warm in memory, panel bursts share one parse, filesystem watches over every provider's discovery roots let a no-change fetch skip the scan entirely, and the web dashboard prefetches every period tab at startup. Cold start, mixed CLI versions and any serve failure all fall back to the exact spawn behavior shipped today, and one-shot CLI output is byte-identical. (#956, #957, #959, #960)
- **Spend punchcard in the desktop app.** The hour-of-day × weekday spend matrix from the web dashboard, on the Spend page, fed by a dedicated timeline fetch so every other panel keeps its lean payload. (#962)
- **Top pull requests in the menubar.** The popover shows the period's top three PRs by attributed spend under Models; hidden when the payload carries none. The Workflow strip is retired from the popover — those metrics live in the desktop app, web dashboard and TUI, where there is room to read them. (#962, #963)
- **Mouse-wheel scrolling in the terminal dashboard.** The viewport enables SGR mouse reporting while mounted (three lines per tick, clicks stay inert, tracking restored on quit); click-drag text selection needs Shift held while the dashboard is open. (#951)
- **Credit-metered ChatGPT workspaces (Business / Edu / Enterprise) now show their limit.** These plans report no rate-limit windows, so the admin-set monthly allowance from `spend_control.individual_limit` is shown as a "Monthly usage limit" bar in the desktop app and the menubar. (#833)
- **Combined-device scope in the desktop Dashboard**, mirroring the menu bar. A Local / Combined toggle aggregates paired-device usage in the Overview hero and the menu bar badge, degrading gracefully to the local figure when a peer is unreachable; the badge then shows a dimmed `reachable/total` marker so a momentary drop to the local number reads as "a peer is unreachable" rather than a glitch. (#866, #867, thanks @marcreynolds)

### Added (CLI)
- **Cline CLI provider.** The Cline command-line agent (npm `cline`, 3.x) stores sessions as `~/.cline/data/sessions/<id>/<id>.json` + `<id>.messages.json`, a layout the existing Cline provider never scanned — it requires `tasks/<id>/ui_messages.json` — so every CLI session was silently reported as $0.00, with no warning even under `--verbose`. Added as its own `cline-cli` provider so the shared Cline-family parser (Roo Code, KiloCode, IBM Bob) is untouched; it mirrors the CLI's own root resolution (`CLINE_SESSION_DATA_DIR` → `CLINE_DATA_DIR` → `CLINE_DIR` → `~/.cline`) and reports its probed root through `codeburn doctor`. Per-message cost is metered by the CLI, so `cline-cli` joins the reported-cost pass-through allowlist rather than being re-priced from tokens. (#874)
- **Codex throughput tracking**: per-model Tok/s in the dashboard and report, active time excludes tool wait. (#805, thanks @ihearttokyo)
- `codeburn sync push --attribution` (opt-in): sends git attribution spans — the session→commit correlation from `codeburn yield` (`codeburn.session.attribution` and `codeburn.commit` span types with normalized repo remote, commit SHAs, merged/reverted state, and PR links). Nothing new is sent without the flag; local-only repos and Windows filesystem paths are never emitted as repo identities, and sessions whose project path no longer resolves never inherit the push-time working directory's repo. See docs/sync/README.md "Git attribution".

### Fixed (CLI)
- **Copilot claude-haiku-4.5 store rows now price correctly instead of $0.** The Copilot session-store.db writes the model as `claude-haiku-4.5` (tier-first, dot), but no pricing alias existed for that raw id, so `calculateCost` returned $0 while GitHub billed the real Anthropic rate (e.g., $0.0063536 for a sampled request). Added an alias to the existing correctly-priced `claude-haiku-4-5` row (no new rate invented). The daily cache bumps from v26 to v27 to force re-derivation of already-finalized days, since this id has no self-heal via prefix fallback. (#1093)
- **A pull request no longer swallows a whole repo's spend.** The working-directory correlation rule attributed every session sharing a checkout with a PR-linked session, with no time bound — a repo whose only captured PR link was pasted once attributed a month of unrelated work (129 of 131 sessions on real data) to that PR. Checkout evidence now only attributes sessions overlapping the linked sessions' own activity window. (#961)
- **Shell reads finally count as reads.** `rg`, `grep`, `cat`, `git log` and friends were invisible to the read-edit-ratio detector (90%+ of real reads uncounted on bash-first workflows) while every Bash call counted as a verification step, so `edit → grep → edit` scored as rework. One shared read-shaped-command classifier fixes both detectors; unknown or mutating commands keep the old behavior. (#941, thanks @laulpogan)
- **Phantom corrections from injected skill prose.** The user-correction detector matched "the wrong answer" inside a templated skill prompt, counting the same non-correction four times on real data; "answer" left the wrong-<noun> pattern list, concrete artifacts (wrong file, wrong approach) still count. (#952)
- **Pricing coverage is floored, never rounded.** 99.6% coverage with unpriced calls outstanding rendered as the "100%" reserved for genuinely complete pricing, contradicting the unpriced-model warning on the same screen. Applies to the TUI panel and the web dashboard. (#786, #783)
- **Model efficiency one-shot rate showed 10000% in the web dashboard.** The payload field is already a percent; the dash multiplied by 100 again. (#958)

- **Copilot CLI sessions report their input and cache tokens.** The Copilot CLI writes the same `producer: 'copilot-agent'` in its `session.start` events that VS Code transcripts carry, so content-based detection classified every CLI session as a transcript and skipped its `session.shutdown` rollup — the only place the CLI records input, cache-read and cache-write tokens — leaving cache hit rate at 0.0% and dramatically underreporting cost. Whether a file is a transcript is now decided by where discovery found it, never by its contents. Resumed sessions, whose legs each append a cumulative rollup, are billed as per-leg deltas so a growing session never double-counts or goes stale; the GitHub Copilot desktop app writes the same session store, so its usage is covered by the same fix. The copilot session cache takes a parse-version bump and the daily cache bumps from v16 to v17 for the one-time re-parse that heals already-recorded days whose logs still exist. (#944)
- **Copilot CLI subagent runs are attributed to their agent.** Newer CLIs announce delegation with `subagent.started`/`subagent.completed` rather than `subagent.selected`, so delegated turns lost their agent label; the label now also clears when the subagent completes instead of bleeding onto the parent's later turns. Rides the #944 re-parse, so already-cached sessions gain the attribution. (#944)
- **`--project` / `--exclude` now apply to the headline totals, not just the detail panels.** The durable headline unions the carry-forward daily cache with today's live parse, and the cached days were sliced to the requested provider but never to the requested project — so the Overview panel counted excluded projects while By Project / By Activity / By Model (built from the name-filtered parse) left them out, and the two could not be reconciled. Cost, calls, sessions and savings are now sliced out of the per-project day stats the cache has carried since v15. Tokens, models and categories have no per-project split in the cache, so under a project filter they come from the (project-filtered) live parse instead; cached days — or provider slices — carried from before v15 have no project split at all, so they cannot be attributed to a filtered project, and the terminal overview now states how much was set aside rather than folding it into the total. (#864)
- **Codex parser corrections**: fork-replay no longer double-counts `patch_apply_end` and `mcp_tool_call_end`; `exec` is normalized to Bash; `custom_tool_call` events are handled; token_count lines larger than 32 KiB now parse exact token counts instead of estimating. Codex session cache bumps from v7 to v8 for a one-time re-parse. Only tool attribution changes for ordinary sessions, leaving their cost identical; sessions that logged an oversized token_count line are repriced from exact counts instead of an estimate. (#805)

- **Midnight-straddling turns keep both halves.** A turn whose calls span local midnight was attributed whole to its start day, so `codeburn today` under-reported until the turn ended and multi-day totals mis-split it. Calls are now range-filtered inside the turn so each day gets the calls that belong to it, and By Activity and the daily turn counts reconcile with the headline. (#853, thanks @KENSHI601)
- **`--provider <x>` no longer leaks Claude spend into the detail panels.** A provider-filtered run still ran the Claude scan, whose orphan pass re-injected every cached Claude session, so By Project / By Model / By Activity showed Claude usage under, e.g., `--provider cursor` while the headline was correct. (#872, thanks @ozymandiashh)
- **A degraded session parse no longer freezes daily history.** A read-only parse that served a stale or missing session file was treated as complete and finalized days it never covered, freezing warm-cache ingestion; a corrupt refresh lock is now recovered rather than ending ingestion, and a legitimately idle tail is no longer re-derived on every launch. (#856, thanks @avs-io)
- **Pi / Oh My Pi transcripts with a leading title record are discovered.** OMP writes a `type: "title"` line before the session header; discovery now scans a bounded number of leading lines for the first session record instead of requiring it on the first physical line. (#846, #859, thanks @jbspeakr, @avs-io)
- **Nine providers served silently stale numbers after you pointed their env override at a different profile or root.** Kiro, Grok, Kimi, Mux, Mistral Vibe, Zerostack, Codebuff, Goose and Crush each honor an env var that relocates where discovery looks, but the var was never declared in the provider env fingerprint, so the cache section survived the change and kept reporting sessions parsed from the old root — with no diagnostic anywhere. The fix declares those vars, the adjacent OS-set path variables that resolve a discovery root for Claude, IBM Bob, Open Design and Kilo Code on Windows and Linux, Cursor's parse-budget override, and the Vercel AI Gateway credential — which must invalidate the fingerprint because a read-only refresh serves the cached report and would otherwise keep reporting the previous account's usage after a swap. Your next run re-parses the fourteen file-backed providers whose declarations changed — the nine above plus Claude, Cursor, Open Design, IBM Bob and Kilo Code — once, and only once; the Vercel AI Gateway declaration is a read-only-path correction, not a migration (its report is re-fetched on every writable run anyway); Copilot is deliberately NOT included, because declaring its overrides would force a re-parse that can drop OTel history only the cache still holds; `codeburn doctor` names deliberate overrides including the XDG_* vars, never the Windows ambient APPDATA / LOCALAPPDATA, and redacts credential values. (#920)


### Fixed (Desktop & Menubar)
- **Menubar icon on macOS 26.5.x: best-available fix for the never-rendering status item.** The app now activates with the window server before creating its status item — the half of the original #147 fix that the ghost-item fix removed — with the activation policy pinned so neither historical bug can return. Falsifiable on this release by affected 25F80 machines. (#868, #955, analysis by @ozymandiashh)
- **Punchcard tooltips no longer crop** at the container edges (top rows flip the tooltip below the cursor). (#963)

### Fixed
- Claude Desktop and Cowork sessions are discovered for Windows Microsoft Store (MSIX) installs. (#611)
- Cline tasks are discovered in every VS Code variant (VS Code, VS Code Insiders, VSCodium), not just stable VS Code. (#874)

## 0.9.19 - 2026-07-20

One version across every surface: CLI, macOS menubar, and the desktop app all ship as 0.9.19.

### Accuracy
- **Every surface now shows the same numbers.** CLI, TUI, menubar, desktop app, and web dashboard totals all come from one durable aggregation path and match exactly, including history whose session logs have since been deleted; the terminal overview notes how much was preserved from expired logs. (#755, #760, #759)
- **Never lose history again.** The daily cache carries forward every (day, provider) slice a re-parse can no longer derive, and adopts days from older cache generations instead of wiping them on schema changes. (#755)
- **True Lifetime period** on the CLI, dashboard, desktop app, and menubar. The desktop tab formerly labeled "All time" showed a 6-month window; it now says "Last 6 months", and Lifetime is the real all-time view. (#753, #759)
- Yield repo grouping is case-correct on macOS/Windows; skills usage is attributed regardless of turn category; daily-activity history scans are bounded. (#751, #745, #727)
- **Days before recorded history render as "No data recorded"**, never as a currency zero, in the desktop heatmap, daily charts, and web dashboard. Genuinely idle days keep their true zeros. (#765)
- Incremental append parsing falls back to a full re-parse when a streamed assistant message restates across the append boundary, fixing a rare over-count on image-heavy sessions. (#772)
- Turn-level stats (edit turns, one-shot, category counts) attribute to exactly one provider slice, so per-provider sums always equal day totals. (#762, thanks @ozymandiashh)
- Workflow-intelligence accuracy pass from review: corrections count only follow-up prompts, file-churn paths are separator-normalized so the payload's basename privacy redaction works on Windows, pricing coverage excludes deliberately-free local models and reports null (never a fabricated 100%) when not computable, and time-to-first-edit is null rather than mismeasured on unparseable timestamps. (#763, review by @ozymandiashh)
- Daily-history retention extended from 2 to 10 years so carried days can never age out of the durable record; quota pace guards non-finite inputs; the exchange-rate cache honors CODEBURN_CACHE_DIR. (#764, #766)

### Added (CLI)
- **Quick Desktop provider** — Amazon Quick Desktop usage from `~/.quickwork`, with real metered costs and multi-profile discovery. (#735, thanks @gjmveloso, @Enclavet)
- **Kimi Code provider** — Kimi Code CLI (kimi-k3) wire sessions from `~/.kimi-code`. (#750, #747)
- **Workflow intelligence** in `optimize` and the payload: user-correction rate, median time to first edit, most-reworked files, pricing coverage, and coaching notes. (#756)
- **Richer session capture**: git branch, lines added/removed (counted from diffs, never stored as text), interruptions, tool errors, session titles, and PR links now land in the local cache for upcoming per-branch and code-impact reports. (#758)
- Provider-agnostic quota window model with provenance; `doctor` warns when transcript retention is about to expire history. (#740, #757)

### Performance
- Large-line session parsing is ~2x faster (single-pass field extraction), and files that grew by append are parsed incrementally from the cached offset instead of from byte 0. (#752, #749)
- **Concurrent CLI, menubar, and MCP processes can no longer clobber each other's cache work**: the warm session-cache refresh runs under a strict cross-process gate with heartbeat, staleness takeover, and a publication fence; a timed-out waiter serves the prior complete snapshot read-only instead of racing. (#743, thanks @avs-io)

### Desktop app
- **Windows fixed**: the CLI is now found on every Windows install (path handling was POSIX-only, breaking 100% of Windows installs). (#733)
- **In-app update notifications** and an About-dialog update check; this is the first release existing 0.9.17 installs will be notified about. (#722, #738)
- Faster and calmer on data-heavy machines: CLI spawns are capped and prioritized so clicks never queue behind background work, provider prefetch is paced, and the default period is Today. (#748)
- Telemetry (opt-in, anonymous) reports per-provider spend buckets, richer error detail with a per-kind daily cap, and a reliable session-close beat. (#736, #742, #746)

### Menubar
- Codex quota windows show linear pace: deficit/reserve, projection, and run-out ETA. (#728, #726)

## 0.9.15 - 2026-07-02

### Added (CLI)
- **`codeburn context`.** See what fills a session's context window, by role,
  block type, and tool: an interactive terminal browser over Claude Code and
  Codex sessions that separates the live window from compacted history and
  anchors estimates to the exact API-reported context size. Also available as
  a Context page in the browser dashboard and scriptable via
  `codeburn context <id> --json`. (#592)
- **Zed provider.** Zed's built-in agent is tracked: per-request token usage
  with full cache fields, topped up to each thread's exact cumulative counter
  and validated token-for-token against a real store. (#594, format documented
  by @chatzinikolakisk in #480)
- **`codeburn audit`.** Per provider-and-model table of where every number
  comes from: calls, input, output, reasoning, cache read/write, cost. (#578)
- **User price overrides** for any model via `codeburn price-override`.
  (#390, #560, thanks @ozymandiashh)
- **open-design provider** for per-model usage tracking. (#559, thanks @ozymandiashh)
- **Browser dashboard**: fully mobile responsive (#582, thanks @ele-yufo; #589),
  instant first paint with the local payload inlined, defaults to today, and
  fast-fails offline paired devices. (#573)

### Fixed (CLI)
- **Cursor tokens are Cursor's own numbers.** Input comes from the
  per-conversation context meter instead of text-length guesses, credited once
  per conversation on a stable anchor so daily history stays consistent across
  re-scans; tools and shell commands come from the agent stream; Composer house
  models price at Cursor's published rates; figures are flagged estimated where
  they are. (#574, #575; closes #326)
- **Copilot Chat users no longer see $0.00**: VS Code core chatSessions
  journals are read for token counts. (#555, #563, thanks @ozymandiashh)
- **Codex** sessions up to 4GB are parsed (streaming cap raised). (#569)
- **Devin** supports ATIF v1.7 (#570, thanks @tvcsantos) and reports friendly
  GPT model names with effort tiers. (#585)
- **OpenCode** skills and subagents breakdowns are populated. (#557, thanks @KevNev19)
- **Pi** native skill loads classify as Skill, not Read. (#588, #590)
- **Cache read/write** scoped to the selected period in web and devices CLI.
  (#583, #586, thanks @ozymandiashh)
- **Web** rejects invalid dashboard periods instead of exiting. (#554, thanks @ozymandiashh)
- **Pricing**: LiteLLM snapshot refreshed; MiniMax-M3 follows MiniMax's tiered
  pricing (standard tier $0.30/$1.20 per M). Daily cache bumped to v10 so
  history re-hydrates under the new Cursor accounting and pricing.

### macOS menubar
- **Local/Combined usage toggle** backed by combined multi-device data in
  menubar-json. (#566, #567, #568, thanks @ozymandiashh)
- **Update dialog** detects a codeburn CLI too old to install menubar updates
  (pre-0.9.9) and shows the exact CLI upgrade command first. (#593)

## 0.9.14 - 2026-06-22

### Added (CLI)
- **Browser dashboard.** `codeburn web` serves a local React dashboard in your
  browser with the same task, model, tool, and project breakdowns as the TUI,
  plus charts. Data is read locally and the server binds to localhost. (#531, #533)
- **Combine usage across your devices.** `codeburn share` exposes one device's
  usage over your local network (PIN-paired), and `codeburn devices` shows
  combined totals by machine. Devices can also be discovered and paired from the
  browser dashboard. (#532, #534, #536)
- **New providers:** Grok Build (#521), ZCode (z.ai GLM-5.2) (#537), Hermes Agent
  (#544), Kiro CLI sessions (#502), and zerostack (#519, thanks @kevinpauer).
- **`codeburn overview`.** Plain-text monthly usage summary that is
  copy-pasteable, with `--no-color` and `--from`/`--to`. (#528, #535)
- **Codex credit usage.** Compute and surface Codex credit consumption alongside
  dollar cost. (#408, #495, #510)
- **MCP server usage in exports.** `codeburn export` now includes per-MCP-server
  usage in both JSON and CSV. (#496, #514)
- **JSON output for `optimize` and `yield`.** (#492, #500)
- **Claude-scoped agent-type breakdown** in the report.
- **OpenCode 1.1+ file-based JSON sessions.** (#523)
- **Copilot OTel cache-token parsing.** (#477, thanks @steelp02; #498)

### Fixed (CLI)
- **Model names in reports.** Models priced through a sibling alias no longer
  show their internal pricing key: ZCode/Hermes GLM-5.2 and Grok Build display
  their real names, gpt-5.5 labels as GPT-5.5, and gpt-5.3-codex-spark is
  distinguished from base GPT-5.3 Codex. (#548, #550, #539 thanks @ozymandiashh)
- **Hermes lowercase glm-5.2** prices the same as GLM-5.2. (#545, thanks @ozymandiashh)
- **Daily cache** purges cached today/future entries on hydration and is bumped
  to v9 so newly supported providers backfill across history without a manual
  cache clear. (#550)
- **Cursor** scans the requested window instead of a blind 250k ROWID cap. (#482, #512)
- **cursor-agent** ingests the workspace-less CLI transcript layout. (#542, thanks @ozymandiashh)
- **Claude Code project names** no longer collapse to a parent folder, and stray
  `.git` directories no longer over-group projects. (#540, thanks @ozymandiashh)
- **Copilot** shell commands and skills/agents display correctly. (#527, thanks @jonjozwiak)
- **Codex** attributes MCP calls emitted as `event_msg`/`mcp_tool_call_end`. (#513)
- **Antigravity** reads the current `agy` CLI on-disk layout. (#541, thanks @ozymandiashh)
- Workflow/ultracode subagent usage is now counted. (#470)
- `--provider` is validated and the non-TTY report is deterministic. (#501)
- The dashboard plan banner is scoped to its own provider tab. (#524)
- Test isolation and environment-collision fixes. (#530, thanks @tvcsantos)

### Added (macOS menubar)
- **Custom daily budget.** Set a custom daily budget amount; the alert respects
  the display metric (Cost or Tokens). (#497, #505, #506)
- **Agent tabs** show every active agent for the selected range, ordered by
  usage. (#549)
- Polished status-item menu and About tab (Star and Sponsor links). (#509)

### Fixed (macOS menubar)
- **Keychain prompts.** Stop repeated keychain prompts on token refresh; read the
  Claude keychain via the `security` CLI on silent refresh. (#490, #491)
- Restore the right-click status-item menu on macOS 27. (#472, thanks @theparlor)
- Support installer HTTP proxies. (#475, thanks @sleicht)
- Surface the CLI's stdout/stderr on a decode failure so a stray banner is
  self-diagnosing. (#515, #547)
- Reduce repeated status parsing and guard against clock skew. (#486, thanks @vaibhavarora14; #499)
- The cost budget stays in USD and an empty custom budget is flagged. (#508)
- Drop the ` tok` suffix from the Total Tokens metric. (#511)

## 0.9.12 - 2026-06-09

### Added (CLI)
- **MCP server.** `codeburn mcp` runs a stdio Model Context Protocol server
  exposing `get_usage` and `get_savings` to AI agents, with project names
  pseudonymized by default (opt-in reveal). (#429)
- **New providers:** Devin (#444), Antigravity IDE (#418), JetBrains —
  IntelliJ/DataGrip via Copilot (#433), coder/mux (#438), and an opt-in
  Vercel AI Gateway datasource via `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` (#432).
- **Automatic pricing gap-fill** from models.dev and OpenRouter for models
  LiteLLM has not indexed yet (e.g. Claude Fable 5). (#457)
- **Proxy-aware cost attribution.** `codeburn proxy-path` marks a project as
  routed through a subscription-backed proxy (e.g. Claude Code over GitHub
  Copilot); the full API-rate cost is reported as subscription-covered so the
  dashboard shows net out-of-pocket, leaving actual cost untouched. (#417, #459)
- **Local-model cost savings reports.** New `codeburn model-savings` command
  maps a local-model name (e.g. `llama3.1:8b`) to a paid baseline (e.g.
  `gpt-4o`) so the dashboard can report the counterfactual spend the same
  tokens would have incurred on the baseline. The local call still costs
  $0; the new `savingsUSD` field tracks the avoided spend separately from
  `costUSD` everywhere a number is shown (dashboard, JSON/CSV exports,
  menubar payload, macOS menubar, GNOME extension, daily cache rollups).
  Historical savings are recomputed automatically when the baseline
  mapping changes (config-hash invalidation on the daily cache). Daily
  cache schema bumped to v8. (#421)
- CNY currency support. (#430)
- Contribution heatmap insight. (#437)

### Added (CLI)
- **Hermes Agent provider.** Track token usage, cost, and tool breakdowns
  for Hermes Agent sessions. Reads from `~/.hermes/state.db` and per-profile
  databases. Supports session-level accounting with actual/estimated costs
  from Hermes, falling back to CodeBurn's model pricing table. Supersedes
  #386, closes #368.

### Fixed (CLI)
- **Per-file parse isolation.** A single malformed session file no longer
  aborts the run or empties the daily-history trend; parse failures are cached
  so broken files are not re-read every run. (#441, #450, #453)
- **Codex fork dedupe** is content-addressed, fixing undercounting of
  divergent events. (#458)
- **Model-name matching on the version boundary** so e.g. `claude-opus-4-6`
  and `claude-opus-4-8` no longer collapse to the same tier. (#417)
- Vercel AI Gateway data now flows through aggregation instead of reporting $0;
  Fable 5 and Mythos 5 price correctly ($10/$50). (#432, #466)
- Cache-read tokens are no longer double-counted in the models report. (#447)
- Critical-path fetches (pricing, currency) now time out so a stalled network
  cannot wedge the CLI or menubar. (#445, #448)
- Cursor lookback is period-aligned with a 6-month floor. (#432)
- **Antigravity hook stale path repair.** `codeburn antigravity-hook install`
  now installs the statusLine command through a persistent `codeburn` binary
  from PATH and repairs older CodeBurn-owned hooks that pointed at stale local
  build artifacts, preventing `agy` from auto-disabling capture after
  `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` failures.

### Added (macOS menubar)
- App icon. (#455)
- Configure `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIRS` from Settings. (#434, #436)

### Fixed (macOS menubar)
- **Refresh reliability.** The app awaits the CLI's exit via its termination
  handler instead of blocking a queue thread, and caps concurrent CLI spawns —
  fixing the menubar wedging on "Loading…" after a long idle. (#462)
- Recover from stuck loading when an in-flight refresh is orphaned across
  sleep/wake. (#412)
- Use the correct currency enum in the Settings picker. (#435)

## 0.9.11 - 2026-05-27

### Added (CLI)
- **MCP project profile advisor.** `codeburn optimize` now flags MCP servers
  that are useful in one project but loaded into other projects where they are
  never invoked, with a project-scoping prompt that preserves the hot workflow
  while reducing cold-project schema overhead. Thanks @ozymandiashh. (#356)
- **MCP and skill reliability report.** `codeburn optimize` now detects MCP
  servers and skills whose edit turns are disproportionately retry-heavy,
  using turn-level MCP/Skill call evidence and a shared-turn token estimate so
  one retry-heavy turn is not double-counted across multiple capabilities.
  Thanks @ozymandiashh. (#357)
- **VSCodium storage discovery.** Copilot, Roo Code, and KiloCode now scan
  VSCodium and VS Code Insiders storage roots in addition to VS Code, so
  usage from VSCodium is included automatically. Thanks @ozymandiashh. (#233)
- **Tooling breakdowns in dashboard and menubar.** New panels showing core
  tools, MCP servers, and shell command usage per session and across periods.
- **File-aware retry detection with typed ToolCall.** One-shot rate now tracks
  which file was edited, so editing file A then file B after a shell step no
  longer counts as a retry. Claude and Codex extract file paths from tool
  inputs; Codex also parses `patch_apply_end` changes and JSON-encoded
  `function_call` arguments. Providers without file path data fall back to
  tool-name-based detection.

### Fixed (CLI)
- **Codex 100% one-shot rate.** Codex function_call arguments are JSON strings,
  not objects, and `patch_apply_end` stores file paths in `changes` object keys.
  Both are now parsed correctly.
- **Claude toolSequence missing from session cache.** `apiCallToCachedCall` was
  not forwarding the `toolSequence` field, so all cached Claude sessions lost
  their tool ordering data.
- **Forge dedup key instability.** The fallback deduplication key used the raw
  message array index, which shifts when messages are deleted between scans.
  Now uses a composite of model name and token counts. Also fixed a variable
  reference before its declaration that would crash at runtime when no tool
  call ID was present.
- **Session cache rejected `subagentTypes` field.** The cache validator did not
  recognize the `subagentTypes` array, causing entries with this field to be
  silently dropped and reparsed on every run.
- **Conflicting date flags on `status` accepted silently.** Passing `--day`
  with `--from`/`--to`, or `--days` with any other date flag, produced
  undefined behavior. Now exits with a clear error message.

### Changed (CLI)
- **OpenCode provider uses shared SQLite parser.** Delegates to
  `sqlite-session-parser.ts` (same module KiloCode uses), reducing the
  provider from 498 to 66 lines with no behavior change.

### Added (macOS menubar)
- **Configurable menubar status period.** The menubar dropdown now lets you
  choose which period (Today, 7 Days, Month, All Time) is shown in the status
  bar. Persisted via UserDefaults. Thanks @ozymandiashh. (#302)

### Fixed (macOS menubar)
- **Loading watchdog killed healthy CLI fetches.** The recovery loop ran every
  8 seconds with no backoff. Each attempt reset the generation counter,
  discarding in-flight CLI responses (45s timeout) before they could finish.
  Replaced with exponential backoff (8s to 60s, 6 attempts max) that skips
  recovery when a fetch is already in flight. Shows an error overlay with a
  Retry button after all attempts are exhausted.
- **Multi-day cache key mismatch.** `selectedDay` returned the earliest date
  instead of nil when multiple days were selected, and
  `startInteractiveSelectionRefresh` did not pass the day set to the cache key
  constructor. Both now match `PayloadCacheKey` normalization rules.
- **Dead code cleanup.** Removed `RefreshBackoff.swift`, its test file, and a
  broken test that called methods deleted in #393.

## 0.9.10 - 2026-05-20

### Added (CLI)
- **Agent and subagent tracking coverage across providers.** Gemini sessions
  now emit one provider call per assistant message with token usage instead of
  one aggregate call per session, preserving per-message tools, bash commands,
  timestamps, and nearest user prompts. Existing cached aggregate Gemini
  entries are reparsed so the new per-message shape takes effect, and per-tool
  counts may increase because repeated tools are now attributed to the specific
  Gemini message that used them. Claude discovery also scans direct
  project-level `subagents/*.jsonl` files, and Codex agent tool normalization
  is covered by regression tests. Addresses #336. Thanks @ozymandiashh. (#340)
- **Optimize tab with retry tax, routing waste, and token display modes.** New
  `codeburn optimize` surface in the dashboard and menubar, with daily budget
  alerts and project drill-down. (#349)

### Fixed (CLI)
- **OpenCode child sessions are attributed to their root session.** The
  OpenCode parser now walks the unarchived `session.parent_id` subtree so
  child and grandchild agent sessions contribute token and tool usage under
  the discovered root session while still excluding child sessions from
  top-level discovery to avoid double counting. Thanks @ozymandiashh. (#343)
- **OpenCode router sessions with missing usage are still reported.**
  Some OpenCode router/provider combinations can persist assistant messages
  with text or tool activity but zero token and cost fields. The OpenCode
  parser now keeps those turns as zero-cost calls instead of dropping the
  session entirely. Closes #341. Thanks @ozymandiashh. (#342)
- **OpenCode and Goose sessions on fresh installs.** Both providers returned
  zero sessions on first run when their on-disk directories did not yet exist.
  Discovery now treats missing directories as empty instead of erroring out.
  (#347)
- **One-shot rate detection for all non-Claude providers.** Retry detection
  now sees multi-message flows correctly across providers, not only Claude.
  Follow-up to the v0.9.9 fix. (#355)
- **Cursor `#cursor-ws=` compound-path separator in `fingerprintFile`.**
  `session-cache.ts` only handled the OpenCode `:` separator, so Cursor's
  workspace-aware paths could fall back incorrectly. The fingerprint now
  strips both `#` and `:` compound suffixes. Thanks @renerichter. (#358)
- **Per-provider multi-day data loss, division-by-zero, and decode
  fragility.** Switching to Claude/Codex tab on 7-day/30-day/month periods
  previously only showed today's categories, models, sessions, and tokens
  because the cache shortcut only merged cost/calls. Per-provider periods now
  always do a full parse. Also floors `maxCost` at 0.01 to avoid NaN bar
  widths in ActivitySection and ModelsSection. (#362)
- **Kiro post-February 2026 storage discovery.** The Kiro provider now keeps
  legacy `.chat` support while also discovering extensionless session index
  files and nested execution files. Modern execution JSON is parsed for
  identifiers, timestamps, model IDs, conversation text, structured tools, and
  estimated token usage. Thanks @ozymandiashh. Closes #329. (#339)

### Fixed (macOS menubar)
- **Per-provider refresh latency.** Switching provider tabs took ~24s on heavy
  histories. Now ~2s via session cache safety and reuse. (#344)

## 0.9.9 - 2026-05-15

### Added (CLI)
- **IBM Bob provider.** Discovers IBM Bob IDE task history, reuses the
  Cline-family parser for token/cost records, extracts model tags and
  workspace-based project names from session data. Closes #248.

### Fixed (CLI)
- **One-shot rate detection for non-Claude providers.** Gemini and Mistral Vibe
  now emit per-assistant-message calls grouped by user turn, so retry detection
  sees multi-message `Edit -> Bash -> Edit` flows instead of counting each
  message as an independent one-shot turn. Kiro and Goose record per-message
  tool ordering via `toolSequence` for the same effect on aggregated sessions.
  Vibe prefers `meta.json.stats.session_cost` over price-derived estimates when
  available. Session cache bumped to v2. Closes #351.
- **Reduced Claude parser OOM risk.** Large Claude JSONL sessions retained
  full entry objects (text, thinking blocks, tool results) in memory during
  parsing, causing V8 heap exhaustion on heavy usage months. Entries are now
  compacted immediately after JSON.parse, keeping only the fields needed for
  cost/token aggregation. This is a mitigation - very heavy users may still
  need the streaming parser refactor planned next.
- **Eager daily-cache hydration caused OOM on most CLI commands.** Eight
  commands (report, today, month, export, optimize, compare, models, yield)
  called `hydrateCache()` which parses a 365-day backfill, even though only
  `status --format menubar-json` consumes the daily cache. Removed from all
  paths that parse their own date ranges via `parseAllSessions`.
- **Session cache retained between status parses.** The `status --format json`
  path parsed today and month ranges without clearing the in-process session
  cache between them, keeping both result sets pinned. Cache is now cleared
  after each period is consumed.
- **Claude 1-hour cache write pricing.** 1-hour cache writes are now priced
  at 2x base input (previously used the 5-minute 1.25x rate for all writes).
  Daily cache bumped to v6 so stale totals are recomputed. Closes #276.
- **OpenCode MCP usage now counted.** OpenCode stores MCP tool calls as
  `<server>_<tool>` names, which the shared MCP pipeline did not recognize.
  The provider now normalizes these to the canonical `mcp__<server>__<tool>`
  form so MCP breakdowns and `optimize` work correctly. Closes #308.
- **Antigravity Windows language-server discovery.** Antigravity detection now
  supports Windows process discovery, `--extension_server_port`,
  `--extension_server_csrf_token`, `--flag=value` syntax, and both wrapped and
  unwrapped Connect-RPC response shapes. Closes #249.
- **Mangled project names in dashboard.** The By Project and Top Sessions
  panels decoded slugs by splitting on `-`, which broke directory names
  containing dashes or dots (e.g. `my-project` rendered as `my/project`).
  Now uses the real project path instead. Closes #320.
- **Cursor undated bubble rows misattributed to Today.** Bubble rows without
  a `createdAt` timestamp were defaulting to the current date, inflating
  Today's spend. Now skipped at both the SQL and application level.
- **Node version guard.** Running on Node < 22.13.0 now prints a clear
  upgrade message instead of crashing with a cryptic `node:sqlite` parse
  error. Closes #319.

### Fixed (macOS menubar)
- **All-provider refresh OOM.** Refreshing with provider set to "All" could
  exhaust the V8 heap on accounts with heavy session history.
- **Tab refresh recovery.** Switching tabs during a refresh no longer leaves
  the panel in a stale loading state.
- **Stale cache recovery.** The menubar now detects and discards a corrupt or
  outdated on-disk cache instead of rendering zeroes until the next restart.
- **Refresh timer hardening.** The 30-second auto-refresh timer is now
  cancelled on sleep/wake and restarted cleanly, preventing overlapping
  refreshes after lid-open.
- **Version display.** The settings panel now shows the version without the
  `v` prefix for consistency with `codeburn --version`.

## 0.9.8 - 2026-05-10

### Added (CLI)
- **Cline provider support.** CodeBurn now reads Cline task usage from both
  VS Code globalStorage (`saoudrizwan.claude-dev`) and Cline's
  `~/.cline/data` task root. It reuses the existing Cline-family parser for
  `ui_messages.json` usage entries, deduplicates migrated tasks by the newest
  `ui_messages.json`, and exposes Cline in CLI provider filters, docs, and the
  macOS menubar provider tabs. Closes #130.
- **Multiple Claude config directories.** Set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIRS` to an
  OS-delimited list of paths (`:`-separated on POSIX, `;`-separated on
  Windows) to scan more than one Claude data directory in a single run.
  Sessions across every configured directory roll up into one project row
  per project, so a user with `~/.claude-work` and `~/.claude-personal`
  who works on the same repo from both accounts sees one combined row
  rather than two split rows. `~` is expanded; missing or unreadable
  directories in the list are skipped instead of aborting the scan; if
  every listed entry is unreadable a one-line hint is written to stderr
  so a misplaced delimiter does not silently produce zero rows.
  Precedence: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIRS` > `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` > `~/.claude`.
  As part of this change `~` and `~/foo` are now also expanded in
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (previously the value was passed through verbatim,
  which only worked when the shell expanded `~` before exporting).
  Closes #208.
- **`codeburn models` command.** Per-model breakdown across all providers,
  one row per (provider, model), sorted by cost. Each row carries Input,
  Output, Cache Write, Cache Read, Total, and Cost columns plus a Top Task
  cell showing the dominant task category and its cost share (e.g.
  `Coding (42%)`). Pass `--by-task` to explode each model into one row per
  task type, with provider/model cells blanked on subsequent rows of the
  same group and a horizontal divider between groups. Filters: `--period`
  (default `30days`), `--from/--to`, `--provider`, `--task`, `--top`,
  `--min-cost`, `--no-totals`. Output formats: `table` (Unicode box-drawn,
  default), `markdown` (GitHub-flavored, copy-paste friendly), `json`,
  `csv`. The table renderer auto-sizes every column to its content and
  drops cache columns first, then input/output, then top-task when the
  terminal is too narrow to fit the full set. Headers are cyan, totals row
  is yellow, provider name is dim. Inspired by tokscale's per-model table
  and ccusage's responsive cli-table3 layout, ported to plain Node with
  no new runtime dependency.
- **Per-day one-shot data in `--format json`.** Each entry of `daily[]` now
  carries `turns`, `editTurns`, `oneShotTurns`, and `oneShotRate` (0-100,
  one decimal, `null` when no edit turns). Counts match the existing
  period-level `activities[]` rollup so a consumer can sum across days and
  reconcile. Closes #279.

### Fixed (CLI)
- **Cursor sessions break down by project, not one row called "cursor".**
  Cursor's chat history sat under a single dashboard row labeled `cursor`
  because the provider had no way to attribute bubbles to a workspace.
  The fix walks `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage/*`
  for each workspace's `workspace.json` (folder URI) and
  `composer.composerData` (the composer ids opened in that workspace),
  then joins those composer ids against the global bubbles. Each
  workspace becomes its own project row, sanitized into the same slug
  shape Claude uses (e.g. `-Users-you-myproject`); composers that have
  no workspace mapping (multi-root workspaces, "no folder open"
  sessions, deleted workspaces) remain under a catch-all `cursor` row.
  As part of this the cursor parser now derives `sessionId` from the
  bubble row key (`bubbleId:<composerId>:<bubbleUuid>`) instead of the
  empty `conversationId` JSON field, which was always falling back to
  `'unknown'`. Cursor result cache version bumped to 3 to invalidate
  prior caches that recorded the old session id. Closes the per-project
  half of #196.
- **Cursor cost shown for every model, not just Auto.** Cursor emits model
  names in a `claude-<dot-version>-<tier>` shape (`claude-4.6-sonnet`,
  `claude-4.5-opus`, `claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking`, etc.) plus its own
  `composer-1` house model, none of which match the canonical LiteLLM
  pricing keys (`claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-5`). The alias map in
  `src/models.ts` filled some of these in v0.9.4 but missed the plain
  no-suffix forms (`claude-4.5-opus`, `claude-4.5-sonnet`,
  `claude-4.6-opus`), the haiku tier, the forward-looking 4.7 variant,
  and `composer-1`. The dashboard rendered $0 for sessions that used any
  unaliased model. Visible to users in #159 even after the v0.9.4 fix.
  Every Cursor variant in `src/providers/cursor.ts:modelDisplayNames`
  now has an alias and a regression test asserting non-zero pricing
  resolution. Closes #159.
- **Activity classifier no longer mislabels feature work as debugging.**
  Messages like "add error handling", "create an issue tracker", or
  "implement the 404 page" used to land in the Debugging bucket because
  the classifier checked the debug-keyword regex (which matches `error`,
  `issue`, `404`) before the feature regex. Now the keyword that appears
  earliest in the user message wins, so "add" beats "error", "create"
  beats "issue", etc. A real bug report ("login is broken, traceback
  below") still classifies as debugging because the debug word leads.
  Fixes the activity-misattribution half of #196.

### Changed (CLI)
- **`optimize` suggestions now declare their destination.** Every paste-style
  fix carries an explicit destination — `claude-md` (permanent project rule),
  `session-opener` (one-time paste at the start of a future session),
  `prompt` (one-time ask in the current chat), or `shell-config` (append to
  `~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc`). Output renders a clearly-labeled section header
  per destination so users no longer accidentally bake one-time session
  openers into their CLAUDE.md as permanent rules. Closes #277.

## 0.9.7 - 2026-05-07

### Added (CLI)
- **MCP tool coverage detector.** New `optimize` finding flags MCP servers
  whose tool inventory is largely unused. Inventory is observed from the
  Claude `deferred_tools_delta` JSONL attachments (exact tool names per
  session) instead of guessed at five tools per server. Token-savings
  estimates are cache-aware: schema bytes pay full input price on the first
  cache-creation turn of a session, then carry at the cache-read discount
  on subsequent turns, capped per call so we never claim more overhead
  than the call's own cache buckets could contain. Threshold:
  >10 tools available, <20% coverage, observed in ≥2 sessions. Closes #2.
- **Session cost outlier detector.** New `optimize` finding flags sessions costing more than 2x their peer-session average within the same project. Ignores sub-$1 outliers to avoid noise. Requires at least 3 sessions per project for a baseline.
- **Context bloat detector.** New `optimize` finding flags sessions where
  effective input/cache tokens are large and disproportionate to output.
  Cache reads are discounted in the estimate to avoid overstating cheap cached
  context. The report highlights top sessions by imbalance, notes sharp
  growth from the previous project session (within a 7-day baseline window),
  and suggests starting fresh with only the current goal, relevant files,
  failing output, and constraints. Sessions flagged here are excluded from
  the cost-outlier finding so the same session is not listed twice.
- **Worth-it score detector.** New `optimize` finding flags expensive sessions
  with weak delivery signals: no edit turns, repeated retries, or edit work
  that never landed in one shot, when no `git`/`gh` delivery command is
  observed. Framed as a conservative review candidate, not proof of waste.
  Sessions flagged here take priority and are excluded from both the
  context-bloat and cost-outlier findings so the same session is not listed
  more than once.
- **Per-model efficiency metrics.** JSON report includes edit turns, one-shot rate, retries per edit, and cost per edit for each model.
- **Custom date range export.** `codeburn export --from --to` exports a single custom period.
- **Live Claude quota bar.** Menubar shows real-time quota usage inside the agent tab strip with OAuth refresh gate.

### Fixed (CLI)
- **Invalid `--format` silently accepted.** All commands now reject unknown format values with a clear error and exit 1 instead of silently falling back to the default.
- **Invalid `--period` silently accepted.** `getDateRange()` no longer falls back to "week" on unknown periods. All period-accepting commands reject invalid values.
- **`status` help text.** Description said "today + week + month" but only today and month were shown. Fixed to match actual output.
- **Windows Claude project paths.** Claude Code project rollups now prefer
  the canonical `cwd` stored in session JSONL files instead of reconstructing
  paths from lossy directory slugs, and group case/slash variants together.
  Closes #217.
- **`all` period semantics unified between CLI and dashboard.** The dashboard treated `--period all` as all-time (epoch start) while the CLI bounded it to the last 6 months. Both now consistently mean "Last 6 months". Period helpers (`Period`, `PERIODS`, `PERIOD_LABELS`, `toPeriod`, `getDateRange`) consolidated into `cli-date.ts`. Use `--from` / `--to` for unbounded historical ranges.
- **Popover anchor, tab strip flicker, and stale-data refresh.** Batch of UI regressions from the menubar hardening round.
- **Validator hardenings.** Batch of edge-case fixes from the multi-agent bug hunt.
- **Command injection in yield.** `yield` now uses `execFileSync` instead of `execSync` to prevent shell injection via crafted branch names.
- **SHA-256 checksum verification.** Menubar installer verifies download integrity before replacing the running app.

### Fixed (macOS menubar)
- **Stuck loading spinner.** The menubar ran `--optimize` on every 30-second background refresh. As sessions accumulated, optimize exceeded the 45-second timeout, and the loading overlay stayed forever with no fallback. Optimize is now stripped from all menubar fetches (use `codeburn optimize` in the CLI instead). On fetch failure with empty cache, the app retries without optimize so the spinner always clears.
- **Stale data after overnight sleep.** Cache keys used the period enum (`.today`) not a calendar date, so data from yesterday persisted after midnight. Cache now tracks the current date and clears itself on day rollover. Wake-from-sleep additionally clears all cached entries before fetching fresh data.
- **Refresh button appeared to do nothing.** Clicking refresh with stale cached data never showed the loading overlay because loading state only triggered on empty cache. Manual refresh and wake-from-sleep now explicitly request loading feedback.
- **Update button stuck spinning forever.** `performUpdate()` only reset `isUpdating` on failure. On success the installer kills and relaunches the app, but if the process survives (pkill fails silently), the button stayed on "Updating..." permanently. Now always resets on termination and clears the update badge on success.

## 0.9.6 - 2026-05-03

### Added (CLI)
- **Goose provider.** New provider for Block's Goose AI coding assistant.
- **Antigravity provider.** New provider for Antigravity IDE sessions.
- **Antigravity model aliases.** gemini-3-pro, flash-image, flash-lite, and community-contributed Gemini model IDs.
- **GPT-5.5 display name** for Codex.
- **Deno support.** `deno dx` added as a run method.

### Fixed (CLI)
- **Streaming dedup.** Claude Code streams each `message.id` multiple times (start, intermediate, stop). The old keep-first strategy lost tool_use blocks and understated output tokens by ~6.3%. Now keeps last occurrence content with first occurrence timestamp for correct date bucketing.
- **`$0.0000` display.** Near-zero costs showed four decimal places instead of `$0.00`. Fixes #205.
- **ANSI escape stripping.** Shell commands containing ANSI color codes now cleaned across all providers.
- **Antigravity dedup collision.** Fixed key collision in session dedup. Added Codex ChatGPT Plus token estimation.
- **Codex large session validation.** Reads full first line for session meta validation; caps read size and handles torn writes.
- **Codex fork dedup.** Deduplicates forked Codex sessions to avoid double-counting.
- **Windows dashboard hang.** Fixed `ExperimentalWarning` and dashboard freeze on Windows.
- **Hardcoded `$` in forecast.** Forecast comparison text now uses the configured currency symbol.

### Fixed (macOS menubar)
- **Provider tabs showing $0.00 after idle.** CLI timeout increased from 20s to 45s for cold file-cache latency. Loading overlay now appears when the all-provider payload confirms a provider has spend but its dedicated data hasn't loaded yet.
- **Refresh button blocked by in-flight requests.** Manual refresh now bypasses the in-flight guard so users can always re-fetch.
- **Tab strip vs hero cost mismatch.** Tab strip prefers the provider-specific payload cost when available, staying in sync with the hero section.
- **Ghost status item on macOS Tahoe.**

## 0.9.5 - 2026-05-01

### Added (CLI)
- **Homebrew.** `brew install codeburn` (originally via tap, now in homebrew-core).
- **GPT-5.3 and DeepSeek display names.** GPT-5.3, DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek Coder Max, DeepSeek R1.

### Fixed (macOS menubar)
- **Menubar refresh loop.** Was a single-fire Task that never repeated; now a proper while loop with 30s interval and `force: true`.
- **Loading overlay flicker.** Counter-based `isLoading` so concurrent fetches don't toggle the overlay.
- **Rapid tab switching race.** Previous fetch is cancelled when switching tabs; stale results are discarded via `Task.isCancelled`.
- **Tab strip vs hero cost desync.** Provider-specific and all-provider data now fetched in parallel so costs arrive from the same snapshot.
- **Stale menubar icon after wake.** `forceRefresh` now fetches today/all in parallel alongside the current selection.
- **Accent color propagation.** `ThemeState` is now `@Observable`; removes `.id()` view hierarchy teardown hack.
- **Currency flash on first switch.** Symbol and rate now apply atomically — no more wrong-symbol-with-old-rate flash.
- **Export UI freeze.** Uses `terminationHandler` instead of `waitUntilExit`; HHmmss in filename prevents overwrite on double-export.
- **CurrencyState concurrency.** Proper `@MainActor` isolation with `Sendable` conformance; `nonisolated` on pure static functions.
- **Streak count.** Iterates calendar days instead of sparse history entries so gaps correctly break streaks.
- **TrendBar chart flicker.** Stable date-based identity instead of UUID.

## 0.9.4 - 2026-04-29

### Added (CLI)
- **OpenClaw provider.** Parses JSONL agent logs from `~/.openclaw/agents/` with legacy path support (`.clawdbot`, `.moltbot`, `.moldbot`). Token usage from assistant message `usage` blocks.
- **Roo Code provider.** Reads Cline-family `ui_messages.json` from VS Code `globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/tasks/`.
- **KiloCode provider.** Reads Cline-family `ui_messages.json` from VS Code `globalStorage/kilocode.kilo-code/tasks/`.
- **Qwen CLI provider.** Parses JSONL sessions from `~/.qwen/projects/<project>/chats/`.
- **Droid provider.** Parses sessions from `~/.factory/projects/`.
- **Durable daily cache.** Cache hydration extracted into shared `ensureCacheHydrated()` called by all commands. Schema migration fills missing fields instead of nuking the cache. Old cache versions backed up before reset. Atomic file writes with fsync.
- **Copilot auto-model buckets.** Transcript inference uses auto-model naming for cleaner dashboard display.
- **Cursor model aliases.** Built-in aliases for Cursor proxy model names.

### Fixed (CLI)
- **Gemini provider updated for JSONL format.** Supports Gemini CLI 0.39+ which switched from JSON to JSONL.
- **Duplicate `hydrateCache()` call in JSON reports.** Removed redundant cache hydration inside `runJsonReport()`.

### Changed (CLI)
- Daily cache version bumped to v4 with backward-compatible migration (v2+ supported).
- LiteLLM pricing snapshot replaces hardcoded pricing for Qwen and new models.
- 16 providers now supported (was 10).

### Added (macOS menubar)
- **OpenClaw, Roo Code, KiloCode, Qwen, Droid tabs.** Agent tab strip updated for all new providers.
- **Instant cached data display.** Shows cached data immediately instead of blocking on CLI refresh.

### Fixed (macOS menubar)
- **Menubar stops updating after first load.** Background refresh was silently skipped by the cache TTL guard. Data loaded once, then froze. Fixes #179.
- **Menubar not dimming on inactive screens.**
- **Performance improvements.** Reduced unnecessary redraws and CLI invocations.

### Added (macOS menubar)
- **Right-click context menu.** Right-click the status bar icon for "Check for Updates" and "Quit CodeBurn".
- **Version label in footer.**

### Changed
- README restructured with honeycomb provider hero image, 2x2 screenshot grid, and complete inline reference.
- `bunx codeburn` added as alternative install option.

## 0.9.3 - 2026-04-28

### Added (CLI)
- **Gemini CLI provider.** Parses `~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/chats/session-*.json` from Gemini CLI 0.38+. Uses real embedded token counts (input, output, cached, thoughts) with correct cached/fresh separation to avoid double-charging. Pricing for gemini-3.1-pro-preview, gemini-3-flash-preview, gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-2.5-flash. Tool normalization (ReadFile->Read, SearchText->Grep, Shell->Bash). Closes #166.
- **Kiro provider.** Parses `.chat` JSON session files with token estimation and auto-model naming (`kiro-auto`). Costed at Sonnet 4.5 rates via `BUILTIN_ALIASES`.
- **Copilot VS Code workspace transcripts.** Copilot now reads transcripts from VS Code's `workspaceStorage/*/GitHub.copilot-chat/transcripts/` in addition to the legacy `~/.copilot/session-state/` path. Tokens estimated from content length, model inferred from tool call ID prefixes. Fixes #161.
- **Auto-model naming.** Cursor, Copilot, and Kiro store transparent model names (`cursor-auto`, `copilot-auto`, `kiro-auto`) instead of guessing the underlying model.

### Fixed (CLI)
- **Cursor provider dropped all data older than 35 days.** Hardcoded lookback silently excluded bubbles outside a 5-week window, making `--period all` return $0. Increased to 180 days. Fixes #159, fixes #163.
- **Cursor-agent subagent transcript discovery.** Scans `subagents/` subdirectories.

### Added (macOS menubar)
- **Gemini, Kiro, Copilot, OMP tabs.** Agent tab strip now shows all detected providers. Cursor + Cursor Agent merged into a single Cursor tab.
- **Accent color picker.** 9 Apple-style system presets in the menubar header, persisted via UserDefaults.
- **Tab costs match selected period.** Provider tab costs now reflect the active period (Today/7 Days/30 Days/etc.) instead of always showing today.

### Changed
- Daily cache version bumped to v4 (forces recompute with auto-model naming).
- Cursor cache versioned to invalidate stale model names.
- Case-insensitive provider key matching for tab cost lookups.

## 0.9.2 - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Cursor provider reported $0 on newer Cursor versions.** Cursor v3 stores zero token counts in bubbles. Now estimates tokens from text length when counts are zero. Fixes #159.
- **Cursor provider dropped rows with NULL `createdAt`.** The SQL filter silently excluded bubbles without a timestamp. Now includes them with a fallback timestamp. Fixes #163.
- **AgentKv entries with plain string content were skipped.** Not all agentKv content is a JSON array; plain strings are now counted toward usage.
- **Subagent transcripts were not discovered.** Transcripts inside `subagents/` subdirectories are now picked up by the cursor-agent provider.

## 0.9.1 - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **`codeburn yield` command.** Correlates AI sessions with git history to categorize spend by outcome: **productive** (code shipped to main), **reverted** (commits later undone), or **abandoned** (work that never committed). Shows percentage breakdown so you know not just what you spent, but what happened to it. Accepts `--today`, `--week`, `--month` flags.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-04-24

### Added (CLI)
- **Claude Max 5x plan preset.** `codeburn plan claude-max-5x` sets a $100/month budget for heavy Claude Code users.

### Fixed (CLI)
- **Cursor provider failed on newer versions.** Cursor 0.50+ stores session data in `agentKv:blob:*` entries instead of `bubbleId:*`. Added fallback parser that extracts usage from the new format.
- **Cursor-agent provider missed Composer 2 sessions.** Composer 2 stores transcripts in `agent-transcripts/<UUID>/<UUID>.jsonl` subdirectories instead of `.txt` files. Now scans both formats. Fixes #142.
- **Codex showed wrong model names.** Model info is now extracted from `turn_context` entries, showing exact names like "GPT-5.4" instead of generic "GPT-5".
- **Codex edit detection showed 0 edit turns.** Codex records file modifications as `patch_apply_end` events, not tool calls. Now tracks these events to enable one-shot rate and retry metrics.
- **Compare chart bar colors didn't match legend.** Non-winning model bars were grayed out despite the legend showing both colors. Bars now always display their assigned colors.

### Fixed (macOS menubar)
- **Menubar icon invisible on macOS Tahoe (26.x).** Status item failed to render on macOS 26.4+ due to window server registration timing. Fixed by starting as regular app, activating, then switching to accessory mode after setup. Fixes #146.
- **High CPU usage (~14%).** Removed duplicate refresh timer, increased LaunchAgent interval to 30s, added 5-second debounce on wake events.

## 0.8.9 - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Menubar showed stale prices.** The "all providers" query used `end: now` while per-provider queries used `end: endOfDay`, causing sessions timestamped after the capture moment to be excluded from totals. Now uses `periodInfo.range` consistently across all queries.

### Changed (macOS menubar)
- **Variable-width status item is now the default.** The menubar pill hugs the rendered text in both compact and default modes instead of reserving a fixed 130pt slot.

## 0.8.8 - 2026-04-22

### Fixed (CLI)
- **OOM crash on large session files.** `scanJsonlFile` and `parseSessionFile` loaded entire files into memory via `readViaStream` (which defeated its own streaming by joining all lines back into one string). Switched both to the existing `readSessionLines` async generator that yields one line at a time. Contributed by @maucher (#132).

### Added (macOS menubar)
- **Compact mode.** Opt-in tighter menubar display: no decimals, variable width that hugs the text. Enable with `defaults write CodeBurnMenubar CodeBurnMenubarCompact -bool true`. Default off.

### Fixed (macOS menubar, shipped alongside via mac-v0.8.8)
- **Plan tab never loaded on Claude Code 2.1.x.** Keychain credential lookup filtered on `kSecAttrAccount == "default"`, but Claude Code writes the macOS login username. Removed the hardcoded allowlist; the service name is sufficient to scope the query.
- **Four keychain prompts on debug builds.** Collapsed two-phase keychain enumeration into a single `SecItemCopyMatching` call.
- **App Nap override not sticking.** The `beginActivity` token was immediately overridden by AppKit. Now disables `automaticTerminationSupport` and `suddenTermination` at the process level.

## 0.8.7 - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **MiniMax-M2.7 and MiniMax-M2.7-highspeed pricing.** Added to `FALLBACK_PRICING` plus display names so MiniMax sessions show up with the right cost and readable labels when users route MiniMax through providers like OpenCode. Rates verified against MiniMax's live paygo pricing: base model $0.3/M input, $1.2/M output; highspeed $0.6/M input, $2.4/M output; cache read $0.06/M, cache write $0.375/M on both.
- **OMP provider (Oh My Pi).** Auto-discovers sessions at `~/.omp/agent/sessions/*.jsonl` and tracks them alongside Pi. Shares Pi's JSONL parser via a `providerName` parameter, so OMP rows keep their own `omp:` dedup prefix and never cross-dedupe with Pi on a shared `conversationId` namespace. `codeburn report --provider omp` filters to OMP only; the default combined view includes both. Contributed by @cgrossde (#59).
- **`codeburn model-alias` command.** Maps any provider-emitted model name to a canonical pricing name so cost rows no longer read `$0.00` when a proxy rewrites names. Aliases persist in `~/.config/codeburn/config.json` under `modelAliases`. Usage: `codeburn model-alias <from> <to>` to set, `--list` to view, `--remove <from>` to clear. User aliases resolve before the built-in list. Contributed by @cgrossde (#59).
- **Built-in aliases for Anthropic-compatible proxy format.** `anthropic--claude-4.6-opus`, `anthropic--claude-4.6-sonnet`, `anthropic--claude-4.5-opus`, `anthropic--claude-4.5-sonnet`, and `anthropic--claude-4.5-haiku` now resolve to canonical Claude names and price correctly with no user configuration. `getCanonicalName` also strips `provider/` prefixes before alias resolution so double-wrapped forms like `anthropic/anthropic--claude-4.6-opus` work the same way. Contributed by @cgrossde (#59).

### Fixed (CLI)
- **Prototype pollution in alias resolution.** A model literally named `__proto__` leaked `Object.prototype` through the `??` fallback chain in `resolveAlias`, which then crashed `canonical.startsWith` downstream. The resolver now uses `Object.hasOwn` checks for both user and built-in alias maps. Caught by the existing prototype-pollution test suite during the #59 merge.

### Fixed (macOS menubar, shipped alongside via mac-v0.8.7)
- **Menubar label froze in the background and only refreshed when you clicked the icon.** Three independent causes fixed:
  - `prefetchAll` on launch spawned four concurrent `codeburn` subprocesses that competed with the main refresh loop for disk and parser time. Removed; period tabs now fetch lazily on first click.
  - `NSStatusItem` sometimes deferred the status bar paint for an accessory app, so `attributedTitle` updates hit memory but not the screen until the popover opened. Explicit `needsDisplay` + `display()` after each update forces the paint.
  - **The real root cause:** macOS App Nap / Automatic Termination was suspending the app whenever the icon sat idle in the background, stretching the 15-second refresh Task's sleep indefinitely. Holding a `ProcessInfo.beginActivity` token for the life of the app opts out. Confirmed via `log show`: `_kLSApplicationWouldBeTerminatedByTALKey` now stays at 0.
- Subprocess `QualityOfService` lifted to `.userInitiated` so `codeburn` runs at terminal speed when spawned from the menubar.

### Skipped
- 0.8.6 was never published to npm. The version was briefly planned and then skipped to align CLI and macOS menubar versioning at 0.8.7.

### Notes
- If you are on 0.8.5 and do not use MiniMax, Oh My Pi, or a proxy that rewrites model names to the `anthropic--claude-X.Y-tier` format, CLI behavior is unchanged and you can safely stay on 0.8.5.
- macOS menubar users on `mac-v0.8.6` or earlier should update: the refresh loop only ticks reliably from `mac-v0.8.7` onward. The in-app update pill surfaces within 2 days, or quit and re-run `npx codeburn menubar` to pull immediately.

## 0.8.5 - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **Stale Today totals after 0.8.2.** The persistent source cache introduced in 0.8.2 caused Today's cost to under-report and sometimes drop between polls during active Claude Code sessions. The cache keyed entries on `(mtime, size)` fingerprints that diverged from Claude's append-mostly JSONL model, producing empty or partial entries that were served on subsequent polls. Reverted the cache rewrite to the v0.8.1 full-reparse path for Claude sessions. Both the menubar and `codeburn status` now return consistent, monotonically-increasing Today totals.
- **Menubar and terminal status disagreed on Today.** A turn that straddled midnight (user message in one day, response in the next) was bucketed by user timestamp in one code path and by assistant timestamp in another, producing different Today values in the two surfaces. Both paths now count a turn on the day its first assistant call ran.
- **Kept from 0.8.2-0.8.4:** subscription plan tracking, pricing accuracy and CSV injection hardening, cursor-agent provider, menubar prefetch and timezone alignment. Only the cache rewrite and its follow-up patches were reverted.

### Removed
- `--no-cache` flag on `report`, `today`, `month`, `status`, `export`, `optimize`, and `compare`. The flag existed to bypass the persistent source cache which no longer exists. If your scripts pass `--no-cache`, drop it; the parse runs fresh every time now.

### Notes
- 0.8.2, 0.8.3, and 0.8.4 on npm contain the buggy cache. Upgrade with `npm i -g codeburn@latest` or `npm i -g codeburn@0.8.5`.
- This release uses a full reparse on every invocation, matching v0.8.1 behavior. On large corpora (5,000+ session files) expect 3 to 10 seconds per invocation. An incremental refresh design that preserves correctness is planned for a follow-up release.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **`codeburn compare` command.** Side-by-side model comparison across any two models in your session data. Interactive model picker, period switching, and provider filtering.
- **Compare view in dashboard.** Press `c` in the TUI to enter compare mode. Arrow keys switch periods, `b` to return.
- **Performance metrics.** One-shot rate, retry rate, and self-correction detection per model. Self-corrections are detected by scanning JSONL transcripts for tool error followed by retry patterns.
- **Efficiency metrics.** Cost per call, cost per edit turn, output tokens per call, and cache hit rate.
- **Per-category one-shot rates.** Breaks down one-shot success by task category (Coding, Debugging, Feature Dev, etc.) for each model.
- **Working style comparison.** Delegation rate, planning rate (TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TodoWrite), average tools per turn, and fast mode usage.
- **TUI auto-refresh enabled by default.** Dashboard now refreshes every 30 seconds out of the box. Pass `--refresh 0` to disable. Closes #107.
- **36 comparison tests.** Full coverage for metric computation, category breakdown, working style, self-correction scanning, and planning tool detection. Total suite: 274 tests.

### Fixed
- **Planning rate showed ~0% in model comparison.** Only counted `EnterPlanMode` (rarely used) instead of all planning tools (TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TodoWrite, EnterPlanMode, ExitPlanMode). Now detects planning at the turn level across all five tool types.
- **Menubar "All" tab showed stale data.** Three-layer caching (300s in-memory TTL, daily disk cache, 60s parser cache) prevented tab switches from showing fresh numbers. Cache TTL reduced from 300s to 30s, tab switches always fetch fresh data, background refresh interval reduced from 60s to 15s.

## 0.7.4 - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **`codeburn report --from/--to`.** Filter sessions to an exact `YYYY-MM-DD` date range (local time). Either flag alone is valid: `--from` alone runs from the given date through end-of-today, `--to` alone runs from the earliest data through the given date. Inverted ranges or malformed dates exit with a clear error. In the TUI, pressing `1`-`5` still switches to the predefined periods. Credit: @lfl1337 (PR #80).
- **`avgCostPerSession` in reports.** JSON `projects[]` entries gain an `avgCostPerSession` field and `export -f csv` adds an `Avg/Session (USD)` column to `projects.csv`. Column order in `projects.csv` is now `Project, Cost, Avg/Session, Share, API Calls, Sessions` -- scripts parsing by column position should read by header instead. Credit: @lfl1337 (PR #80).
- **Menubar auto-update checker.** Background check every 2 days against GitHub Releases. When a newer menubar build is available, an "Update" pill appears in the popover header. One click downloads, replaces, and relaunches the app automatically.
- **Smart agent tab visibility.** The provider tab strip hides when fewer than two providers have spend, reducing clutter for single-tool users.

### Fixed
- **Stale daily cache caused wrong menubar costs.** The daily cache never recomputed yesterday once written, so a mid-day CLI run would freeze partial cost data permanently. The "All" provider view relied on this cache, showing wildly incorrect numbers while per-provider tabs (which parse fresh) were correct. Yesterday is now evicted and recomputed on every run.
- **UTC date bucketing instead of local timezone.** Timestamps in session files are UTC ISO strings. Several code paths extracted the date via `.slice(0, 10)` (UTC date) while date range filtering used local-time boundaries. Turns between UTC midnight and local midnight were attributed to the wrong day -- the menubar showed lower today cost than the TUI. All date bucketing now uses local time consistently.
- **OpenCode SQLite ESM loader.** `node:sqlite` is now loaded correctly in ESM runtime. Credit: @aaronflorey (PR #104).
- **Menubar trend tooltip per-provider views.** Tooltip now shows the correct cost when a specific provider tab is selected.
- **Menubar (today, all) cache freshness.** The cache entry powering the menubar title and tab labels is now kept fresh independently of the selected period/provider.
- **Agent tab strip restored.** All detected providers are shown again after a regression hid them.
- **Plan pane button cleanup.** Removed the broken "Connect Claude" button that opened a useless terminal session. The Plan pane now shows only a "Retry" button.

## 0.7.3 - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **Dropped `better-sqlite3` in favor of Node's built-in `node:sqlite`.** Removes the deprecated `prebuild-install` transitive dependency that npm warned about on every install (issue #75, credit @primeminister). End-user install is now 40 packages down from 167 and shows zero deprecation notices. The experimental-SQLite warning Node 22/23 normally prints on module load is silenced for this specific warning; other warnings pass through unchanged.
- **Minimum Node version raised to 22.** Node 20 reached EOL on 2026-04-30; `node:sqlite` lives in 22+. Users on older Node get a clear upgrade message when a SQLite-backed provider (Cursor, OpenCode) is loaded.


## 0.7.2 - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Native macOS menubar app.** Swift + SwiftUI app under `mac/` replaces the SwiftBar plugin. Agent tabs, Today/7/30/Month/All period switcher, Trend/Forecast/Pulse/Stats/Plan insights, activity and model breakdowns, optimize findings, CSV/JSON export, instant currency switching, live 60s refresh.
- **`codeburn menubar`.** One-command install: downloads the latest `.app` from GitHub Releases, strips Gatekeeper quarantine, drops it into `~/Applications`, and launches it. `--force` reinstalls in place.
- **`status --format menubar-json`.** Structured payload consumed by the native menubar app. Current-period totals, per-activity and per-model breakdowns, provider costs, optimize findings, and 365-day history.
- **Release workflow.** `.github/workflows/release-menubar.yml` builds a universal `.app` bundle and zip on `mac-v*` tag push.

### Changed
- **`codeburn export -f csv`** now writes a folder of one-table-per-file CSVs (`summary`, `daily`, `activity`, `models`, `projects`, `sessions`, `tools`, `shell-commands`) plus a `README.txt` index. Each file opens cleanly as a single table in any spreadsheet.
- **`codeburn export -f json`** upgraded to schema `codeburn.export.v2` with currency metadata.

### Fixed
- **`codeburn status` terminal Today/Month** now buckets by local date instead of UTC, so spend shows correctly during the window between local midnight and UTC midnight.
- **FX rate validation.** Frankfurter responses are checked to be finite and within `[0.0001, 1_000_000]` before they affect displayed costs.

### Removed
- **SwiftBar plugin.** `src/menubar.ts`, `codeburn install-menubar`, `codeburn uninstall-menubar`, and `status --format menubar` are gone. The native Swift app is the single menubar surface.

### Security
- **`codeburn export -o` guard.** Writes a `.codeburn-export` marker into every folder it creates and refuses to reuse non-marked directories or overwrite existing files, so a typo like `-o ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` cannot delete a sensitive file.

## 0.7.1 - 2026-04-17

### Security
- **External security audit closed.** 1 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, and 1 LOW finding fixed. Threat model: a compromised third-party AI CLI with write access to `~/.claude/projects/` dropping malicious session JSONL.
- **Prototype pollution blocked.** Breakdown maps in `parser.ts` (model, tool, MCP, bash) now use `Object.create(null)` so attacker-controlled keys like `__proto__` create own properties instead of mutating `Object.prototype`. Credit: @lfl1337 (PR #67).
- **Bounded session-file reads.** New `src/fs-utils.ts` helper caps reads at 128 MB and switches to stream-based parsing above 8 MB. Applied to 13 reachable read sites across parser, Codex, Copilot, Pi, context-budget, and optimize. Credit: @lfl1337 (PR #67).
- **Menubar label sanitizer.** SwiftBar directive-separator (`|`) and ANSI escape injection via crafted model or category names is now prevented by an allowlist (`[A-Za-z0-9 ._/-]`) plus 14-character truncation. Credit: @lfl1337 (PR #67).

### Added
- **`--verbose` flag.** Global CLI option that prints warnings to stderr on skipped (oversize) or failed session-file reads. Silent by default. Credit: @lfl1337 (PR #67).
- **11 new security tests.** `tests/security/prototype-pollution.test.ts`, `tests/security/menubar-injection.test.ts`, `tests/fs-utils.test.ts`. Total suite: 209 tests.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **`codeburn optimize` command.** Scans your sessions and your `~/.claude/`
  setup for 11 common waste patterns and hands back exact copy-paste fixes.
  Detection-only, never writes to user files. Supports `--period` (today,
  week, 30days, month, all) and `--provider` (all, claude, codex, cursor).
- **Setup health grade (A-F).** Urgency-weighted rollup of all findings, with
  impact scored against observed waste so the most expensive issues rank
  first. High findings penalise more, medium less, low least.
- **Trend tracking.** Repeat runs classify each finding as new, improving,
  or resolved against a 48-hour recent window, so fixed issues disappear
  instead of lingering as noise.
- **11 detectors:** files Claude re-reads across sessions, low Read:Edit
  ratio, projects missing `.claudeignore`, uncapped `BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH`,
  unused MCP servers, ghost agents, ghost skills, ghost slash commands,
  bloated `CLAUDE.md` files (with `@-import` expansion counted), cache
  creation overhead, and junk directory reads.
- **Copy-paste fixes.** Each finding comes with a ready-to-paste remedy: a
  `CLAUDE.md` line, a `.claudeignore` template, an environment variable, or
  a `mv` command to archive unused items.
- **In-TUI optimize view.** Press `o` in the dashboard when the status bar
  shows a finding count, `b` to return. Same engine as the standalone
  command, scoped to the current period and provider.
- **Per-project context budget column.** By Project panel now shows the
  estimated per-session context overhead for each project (system prompt +
  tools + `CLAUDE.md` + skills).
- **34 filesystem-mocking tests.** Tmpdir fixtures with `os.homedir` mocked
  via `vi.mock` cover the detector surface end to end. Total suite: 198
  tests across 13 files.

### Performance
- **mtime pre-filter + parallel reads + 60s result cache** cut a cold scan
  from 12-17s to 6-7s on a 10k-session history.

## 0.6.1 - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **JSON output on `report`, `today`, `month`.** `--format json` writes the
  full dashboard (overview, daily, projects, models, activities, tools, MCP
  servers, shell commands, top sessions) to stdout. Contributed by @mallek.
- **Project filters.** `--project <name>` and `--exclude <name>` on all
  commands (`report`, `today`, `month`, `status`, `export`). Case-insensitive
  substring match against project name and path. Both flags are repeatable.
  Contributed by @mallek.
- **claude-opus-4-7 model mapping and pricing.** Displays as `Opus 4.7` with
  the same Opus pricing as 4.6 and a 6x fast multiplier. Contributed by @mallek.
- **Unit tests for `filterProjectsByName`** covering include/exclude
  semantics, case-insensitivity, path matching, and input immutability.

### Fixed
- **Top Sessions panel truncating the calls column.** Row width filled the
  full panel width without leaving room for the border and padding, so Ink
  truncated the last 4 characters -- landing exactly on the calls column and
  producing rows like `$182.58 ...` with no value.
- **SwiftBar custom plugin directory** now honoured when installing the
  menubar widget. Reads the configured path from SwiftBar's defaults before
  falling back to the standard location. Contributed by @Galeas.
- **`status --format menubar` per-provider today totals** now respect
  `--project`/`--exclude`. The main period blocks already did, the provider
  breakdown loop was the one spot that bypassed the filter.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **GitHub Copilot provider.** Parses `~/.copilot/session-state/*/events.jsonl`
  and tracks model changes via `session.model_change` events. Picks up six new
  model prices (`gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4.1-nano`, `gpt-5-mini`, `o3`,
  `o4-mini`). Contributed by @theodorosD. Note: Copilot logs only output
  tokens, so cost rows will sit below actual API cost.
- **All Time period (key `5`).** Shows every recorded session since CodeBurn
  started tracking. Daily Activity expands to every available day instead of
  the fixed 14- or 31-day window. `codeburn report -p all` also works from
  the CLI. Contributed by @lfl1337.
- **avg/s column in By Project.** Average cost per session next to the
  existing total cost and session count. Surfaces projects where individual
  sessions are expensive even if the total is modest. Contributed by @lfl1337.
- **Top Sessions panel.** Highlights the five most expensive sessions across
  all projects with date, project, cost, and API call count. Helps spot
  outliers that drag weekly or monthly totals. Contributed by @lfl1337.

### Fixed
- `modelDisplayName` now matches longest key first so `gpt-4.1-mini` resolves
  to `GPT-4.1 Mini` instead of `GPT-4.1`.
- `TopSessions` handles missing `firstTimestamp` gracefully with a
  `----------` placeholder instead of rendering a stray whitespace row.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Cursor IDE support.** Reads token usage from Cursor's local SQLite
  database. Shows activity classification, model breakdown, and a Languages
  panel extracted from code blocks. Costs estimated using Sonnet pricing for
  Auto mode (labeled clearly). Supports macOS, Linux, and Windows paths.
- SQLite adapter with lazy-loaded `better-sqlite3` (optional dependency).
  Claude Code and Codex users are completely unaffected if it is not installed.
- File-based result cache for Cursor. First run parses the database (can take
  up to a minute on very large databases); subsequent runs load from cache
  in under 250ms. Cache auto-invalidates when Cursor modifies the database.
- Provider-specific dashboard layout. Cursor shows a Languages panel instead
  of Core Tools, Shell Commands, and MCP Servers (Cursor does not log these).
- Provider color coding in the dashboard tab bar (Claude: orange, Codex: green,
  Cursor: cyan).
- Broader activity classification patterns: file extensions, script references,
  URLs, and HTTP status codes now trigger more accurate categories.
- Debounced period switching. Arrow keys wait 600ms before loading data so
  quickly scrolling through periods skips intermediate loads. Number keys
  still load immediately.
- Dynamic version reading from package.json (no more hardcoded version string).

### Fixed
- CLI `--version` reported stale 0.4.1 since v0.4.2. Closes #38.

## 0.4.4 - 2026-04-15

### Added
- Auto-refresh flag. `codeburn report --refresh 60` reloads data at a set
  interval. Works on `report`, `today`, and `month` commands. Default off.
- Readable project names. Strips home directory prefix from encoded paths,
  shows 3 path segments for more context. Home dir sessions display as "home".
- Responsive dashboard reflows on terminal resize via Ink's useWindowSize
  hook. Width cap raised from 104 to 160 columns. Contributed by @AleBles.
- Total downloads and install size badges in README.

### Fixed
- Agent/subagent session files were excluded, dropping ~46% of API calls.
  Subagent sessions live in separate subagents/ directories with unique
  message IDs and are now included. Closes #17.
- Codex cache hit always showed 100%. OpenAI includes cached tokens inside
  input_tokens (unlike Anthropic). Normalized to prevent double-counting
  in cost calculation and cache hit display. Closes #21.
- CSV formula injection. Cells starting with =, +, -, @ are prefixed with
  an apostrophe before CSV escaping. Contributed by @serabi.
- Menubar "Open Full Report" and "Export CSV" actions broken for npm-installed
  users. Invokes resolved binary directly instead of assuming ~/codeburn
  checkout. Currency picker used nonexistent `config currency` subcommand.
  Contributed by @MukundaKatta. Closes #32, #27.
- Activity panel moved from full-width to half-width row for better space
  usage on wide terminals.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Multi-currency support. `codeburn currency GBP` sets display currency (162 ISO
  4217 codes). Exchange rates from Frankfurter API (ECB data, 24h cache). Applies
  to dashboard, status, menubar, and exports. Contributed by @BlairWelsh.
- 30-day rolling window period (`codeburn report -p 30days`, key `3` in TUI).
  Distinct from calendar month. Contributed by @oysteinkrog.
- Menubar currency picker with 17 common currencies.

### Fixed
- Export "30 Days" period now uses actual 30-day range instead of calendar month.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Codex (OpenAI) support. Parses sessions from ~/.codex/sessions/ with full
  token tracking, cost calculation, task classification, and tool breakdown.
- Provider plugin system. Adding a new provider (Pi, OpenCode, Amp) is a
  single file in src/providers/.
- TUI provider toggle. Press p to cycle All / Claude / Codex. Auto-detects
  which providers have session data on disk. Hidden when only one is present.
- --provider flag on all CLI commands: report, today, month, status, export.
  Values: all (default), claude, codex.
- Codex tool normalization: exec_command -> Bash, read_file -> Read,
  write_file/apply_diff/apply_patch -> Edit, spawn_agent -> Agent.
- Codex model pricing: gpt-5, gpt-5.3-codex, gpt-5.4, gpt-5.4-mini with
  hardcoded fallbacks to prevent LiteLLM fuzzy matching mispricing.
- CODEX_HOME environment variable support for custom Codex data directories.
- Menubar per-provider cost breakdown when multiple providers have data.
- 1-minute in-memory cache with LRU eviction for instant provider switching.
- 10 new tests (Codex parser, provider registry, tool/model mapping).

### Fixed
- Model name fuzzy matching: gpt-5.4-mini no longer mispriced as gpt-5
  (more specific prefixes checked first).

## 0.3.1 - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Shell Commands breakdown panel showing which CLI binaries are used most
  (git, npm, docker, etc.). Parses compound commands (&&, ;, |) and handles
  quoted strings. Contributed by @rafaelcalleja.

### Changed
- Activity panel is now full-width so the 1-shot column renders cleanly
  on all terminal sizes.

### Fixed
- Crash on unreadable session files (ENOENT). Skips gracefully instead.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-04-14

### Added
- One-shot success rate per activity category. Detects edit/test/fix retry
  cycles (Edit -> Bash -> Edit) within each turn. Shows 1-shot percentage
  in the By Activity panel for categories that involve code edits.

### Fixed
- Turn grouping: tool-result entries (type "user" with no text) no longer
  split turns. Previously inflated Conversation category by 3-5x at the
  expense of Coding, Debugging, and other edit-heavy categories.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Claude Desktop (code tab) session support. Scans local-agent-mode-sessions
  in addition to ~/.claude/projects/. Same JSONL format, deduplication across
  both sources. macOS, Windows, and Linux paths.
- CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR environment variable support. Falls back to ~/.claude if
  not set.

### Fixed
- npm package trimmed from 1.1MB to 41KB by adding files field (ships dist/
  only).
- Image URLs switched to jsDelivr CDN for npm readme rendering.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- Readme image URLs for npm rendering.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Interactive TUI dashboard built with Ink (React for terminals).
- 13-category task classifier (coding, debugging, exploration, brainstorming,
  etc.) using tool usage patterns and keyword matching. No LLM calls.
- Breakdowns by daily activity, project, model, task type, core tools, and
  MCP servers.
- Gradient bar charts (blue to amber to orange) inspired by btop.
- Responsive layout: side-by-side panels at 90+ cols, stacked below.
- Keyboard navigation: arrow keys switch Today/7 Days/Month, q to quit.
- Column headers on all panels.
- Bottom status bar with key hints (interactive mode only).
- Per-panel accent border colors with rounded corners.
- SwiftBar/xbar menu bar widget with flame icon, activity breakdown, model
  costs, and token stats. Refreshes every 5 minutes.
- CSV and JSON export with Today, 7 Days, and 30 Days periods.
- LiteLLM pricing integration with 24h cache and hardcoded fallback.
  Supports input, output, cache write, cache read, web search, and fast
  mode multiplier.
- Message deduplication by API message ID across all session files.
- Date-range filtering per entry (not per session) to prevent session bleed.
- Compact status command with terminal, menubar, and JSON output formats.
